As malicious cyber actors have been using most of these top malware strains for more than five years, organizations have opportunities to better prepare, identify, and mitigate attacks from these strains.  \nCISA and ACSC encourage organizations to apply the recommendations in the Mitigations sections of the joint CSA. These mitigations include prioritizing patching all systems with known exploited vulnerabilities, enforcing multifactor authentication (MFA), securing remote desktop protocol (RDP) and other risky services, making offline backups of your data, and providing end-user awareness and training about social engineering and phishing.

          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in signed 3rd party UEFI  bootloaders that allows bypass of the UEFI Secure Boot feature.   An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can bypass the UEFI Secure Boot feature and execute unsigned code during the boot process.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>UEFI firmware is software written by vendors in the <a href=\"https://uefi.org/node/4046\">UEFI ecosystem</a> to provide capabilities in the early start up phases of a computer.  <a href=\"https://edk2-docs.gitbook.io/understanding-the-uefi-secure-boot-chain/secure_boot_chain_in_uefi/uefi_secure_boot\">Secure Boot</a> is a UEFI standard that can be enabled and used to verify firmware and to protect a system against malicious code being loaded and executed early in the boot process, prior to the loading of the operating system.  </p>\n<p>Security researchers at <a href=\"https://eclypsium.com\">Eclypsium</a>  have found three specific UEFI  bootloaders that are signed and authenticated by Microsoft to be vulnerable to a security feature bypass vulnerability allowing an attacker to bypass Secure Boot when it is enabled. The vulnerable bootloaders can be tricked to bypass Secure Boot via a custom installer  (CVE-2022-34302) or an EFI shell (CVE-2022-34301 and CVE-2022-34303). As a vulnerable bootloader executes unsigned code prior to initialization of the the Operating System's (OS) boot process, it cannot be easily monitored by the OS or common Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools.</p>\n<p>The following vendor-specific bootloaders were found vulnerable:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Inherently vulnerable bootloader to bypass Secure Boot<ul>\n<li>New Horizon Datasys Inc (CVE-2022-34302) </li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>UEFI Shell execution to bypass Secure Boot<ul>\n<li>CryptoPro Secure Disk (CVE-2022-34301)</li>\n<li>Eurosoft (UK) Ltd (CVE-2022-34303)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>An attacker can bypass a system's Secure Boot feature at startup and execute arbitrary code before the operating system (OS) loads.  Code executed in these early boot phases can provide persistence to an attacker, potentially loading arbitrary kernel extensions that survive both reboot and re-installation of an OS. It may also evade common OS-based and EDR security defenses.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<h4 id=\"apply-a-patch\">Apply a patch</h4>\n<p>Apply your vendor-provided security updates that address these vulnerabilities to block vulnerable firmware from bypassing Secure Boot.  Microsoft has provided details with their <a href=\"https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5012170-security-update-for-secure-boot-dbx-august-9-2022-72ff5eed-25b4-47c7-be28-c42bd211bb15\">KB5012170</a> article released on August 9th 2022.  Note, these updates can be delivered from your OEM vendor or the OS vendor to install an updated <a href=\"https://uefi.org/revocationlistfile\">Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (DBX) </a>. </p>\n<h4 id=\"enterprise-and-product-developers\">Enterprise and Product Developers</h4>\n<p>As DBX file changes can cause a system to become <a href=\"https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-pulls-security-update-after-reports-of-issues-affecting-some-pcs/\">unstable</a>, Vendors are urged to verify the DBX updates do not cause the machine to be unusable.  Enterprises and Cloud Providers that manage large number of computers are also urged to do the required security updates and ensure DBX files are implemented reliably without any risk of boot failure.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to Mickey Shkatov and Jesse Michael of Eclypsium who researched and reported these vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>This document was written by Brad Runyon &amp; Vijay Sarvepalli.</p>",

This vulnerability can allow unauthenticated users to download arbitrary files and collect private information on the target device.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>The muhttpd, hosted at <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/muhttpd/\">SourceForge</a> as an opensource project, is a lightweight webserver.  This software is commonly used in customer premise equipment (CPE), such as home routers and small office routers, to provide device management capability through a web interface. The muhttpd supports the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface\">CGI</a> scripts that enable remote management of CPE devices.</p>\n<p>A path traversal vulnerability in muhttpd (version 1.1.5 and earlier) could allow an unauthenticated attacker to read arbitrary content on the target device, including usernames and passwords, Wireless SSID configurations, ISP connection information, and private keys.  If remote management is enabled on a device running vulnerable version of muhttpd, this attack is possible from a remote network. Even in cases with restricted Local Area Network access, a vulnerable version of muhttpd can be accessed using other attack methods such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding/\">DNS Rebinding</a>. </p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>An unauthenticated attacker can use crafted HTTP request to download arbitrary files or gather sensitive information from a vulnerable target device. In cases where remote management is enabled on a vulnerable device, a remote unauthenticated attacker can perform these attacks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<h4 id=\"apply-updates\">Apply Updates</h4>\n<p>Update to the latest version of firmware/software provided by your vendor; see <a href=\"#vendor-information\">Vendor Information</a> section for details.  Downstream developers of embedded systems should update muhttpd software (to version 1.1.7 or later) from <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/p/muhttpd/code/ci/main/tree/\">SourceForget git repository</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"disable-remote-management\">Disable remote management</h4>\n<p>Disabling remote management access, which thereby limits access strictly to local area network, can minimize the exposure introduced by the vulnerable software.  Use access control to limit remote management if remote management is desired from specific IP network locations. Additional mitigations are described in the <a href=\"https://derekabdine.com/blog/2022-arris-advisory\">security researcher's advisory</a>. </p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to Derek Abdine for reporting this vulnerability. </p>\n<p>This document was written by Brad Runyon, Vijay Sarvepalli, and Eric Hatleback.</p>",

For example, squid darkened while pursuing prey and then shifted to a half light/half dark pattern immediately before striking.
