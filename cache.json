The joint CSA provides information on the SVR’s most recent compromise, actionable indicators of compromise (IOCs), and SIGMA and YARA rules.\nThe authoring agencies encourage network defenders and organizations review the joint CSA for recommended mitigations and rules.

The draft baselines offer minimum viable security configurations for nine GWS services: Groups for Business, Google Calendar, Google Common Controls, Google Classroom, Google Meet, Gmail, Google Chat, Google Drive and Docs, and Google Sites. The ScubaGoggles tool assesses GWS tenants' compliance against the baselines.   \nFederal agencies and other organizations are invited to adopt the draft baselines in their GWS environments, tailor them to reflect their own unique needs and risk tolerances, and then share their experiences with CISA during the public comment period, which closes Jan. 12, 2024. Comments will ensure that the final published baselines are clear, feasible, and effective.  \nThe draft SCuBA GWS Secure Configuration Baselines is the latest offering from CISA’s SCuBA project, dedicated to securing data stored in the cloud through additional configurations, settings, and security products. These baselines are created in accordance with Executive Order 14028 to provide enhanced visibility into cloud security.  \nComment on SCuBA GWS Secure Configuration Baselines by Jan. 12, 2024.
