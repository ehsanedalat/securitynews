According to FIRST, the purpose of TLP is \"to facilitate greater sharing of potentially sensitive information and more effective collaboration.\" Note: Unlike formal classification systems, TLP is not legally binding.\nTLP Version 2.0 brings the following key updates:\nTLP:CLEAR replaces TLP:WHITE for publicly releasable information.\nTLP:AMBER+STRICT supplements TLP:AMBER, clarifying when information may be shared with the recipient’s organization only.\nNote: CISA’s Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) capability will not update from TLP 1.0 to TLP 2.0 until March 2023. This exception includes AIS’s use of the following open standards: the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX™) for cyber threat indicators and defensive measures information and the Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII™) for machine-to-machine communications.\nAs CISA prepares to implement this update, we want to inform partners of the upcoming change and encourage all network defenders to adopt TLP Version 2.0 to facilitate greater information sharing and collaboration.\nFor more information on TLP, visit FIRST’s TLP webpage at www.first.org/tlp/. On November 1, 2022, CISA will update www.cisa.gov/tlp to reflect the TLP Version 2.0 changes.\n \nThis product is provided subject to this Notification and this Privacy & Use policy.",

          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>Microsoft Exchange 2019 Cumulative Update 23 and earlier versions are vulnerable to a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack and remote code execution.  An authenticated attacker can use the combination of these two vulnerabilities to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary code on the target Exchange server. </p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>Microsoft Exchange Server's <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/architecture/client-access/autodiscover?view=exchserver-2019\"> Autodiscover service</a> is a web service widely available to any Microsoft Exchange Web Services (EWS) client.  Since Microsoft Exchange version 2016, the Autodiscover service has become an integral part of the Microsoft Exchange system, and it is no longer independently provided by a Client Access server.  The Autodiscover service and a number of other privileged mailbox services are hosted on the default Internet Information Services server running on the Mailbox server.  </p>\n<p>Cybersecurity company GTSC <a href=\"https://www.gteltsc.vn/blog/warning-new-attack-campaign-utilized-a-new-0day-rce-vulnerability-on-microsoft-exchange-server-12715.html\">observed an abuse of the Autodiscover service in August of 2022</a> using a crafted URL SSRF attack, similar to the earlier <a href=\"https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/exchange-team-blog/proxyshell-vulnerabilities-and-your-exchange-server/ba-p/2684705\">ProxyShell</a> vulnerability reported in August 2021.  The observed attack appears to have implemented <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-41040\">CVE-2022-41040</a> to gain privileged access and <a href=\"https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2022-41082\">CVE-2022-41082</a> to perform remote code execution via PowerShell.  Microsoft Security Research Center has <a href=\"https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2022/09/29/customer-guidance-for-reported-zero-day-vulnerabilities-in-microsoft-exchange-server/\">acknowledged the vulnerability and provided guidance for mitigation</a>.  The guidance highlights that Microsoft Exchange Online customers will be provided with detection and mitigation defenses automatically from Microsoft's managed Infrastructure, informing them of any attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities. </p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>An authenticated remote attacker can perform SSRF attacks to escalate privileges and execute arbtirary PowerShell code on vulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers.

          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>Layer-2 (L2) network security controls provided by various devices, such as switches, routers, and operating systems, can be bypassed by stacking Ethernet protocol headers. An attacker can send crafted packets through vulnerable devices to cause Denial-of-service (DoS) or to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack against a target network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>This vulnerability exists within Ethernet encapsulation protocols that allow for stacking of Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) headers.  Network standards such as  <a href=\"https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_1Q-1998.html\">IEEE 802.1Q-1998</a> and <a href=\"https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_3-2018.html\">IEEE 802.3</a> define a system of tagging Ethernet frames that help isolate networks to provide virtual networking capability.  IEEE standard <a href=\"https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_1ad-2005.html\">802.1ad</a>, also known as QinQ, allows for the stacking of these VLAN tags, extending the VLAN capability into multiple network segments. This widely adopted Ethernet feature is also referred to as \"provider bridging\" and \"stacked VLANs\".  In order to properly isolate and protect these virtual networks, many network devices and operating systems provide an L2 network filtering capability.   It is important to note that in modern computing environments , such as Cloud based virtualization and virtual networking, the L2 network capability is extended beyond the local area networks.  This can lead to exposure of this vulnerabilities in unintended ways to the larger Internet.</p>\n<p>The identified vulnerabilities allow an attacker to bypass the security controls by stacking encapsulating headers. This is done by stacking a combination of one or more VLAN 0 (priority tag) headers and <a href=\"https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_2-1985.html\">802.2</a> LLC/SNAP headers.  An attacker can send these crafted network packets and exploit vulnerable devices by bypassing their inspection and filtering capabilities.   Some examples of bypassed L2 inspections include, but are not limited to, <a href=\"https://blogs.nwkings.com/what-is-dai-dynamic-arp-inspection/\">Dynamic ARP inspection</a>, <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc4861/\">IPv6 Neighbor Discovery</a> (ND) protection, and <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6105\">IPv6 RA Guard</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>CVE-2021-27853</strong>\nLayer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard or ARP inspection can be bypassed using combinations of VLAN 0 headers and LLC/SNAP headers.</p>\n<p><strong>CVE-2021-27854</strong>\nLayer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using combinations of VLAN 0 headers, LLC/SNAP headers in Ethernet to Wifi frame translation and the reverse Wifi to Ethernet.</p>\n<p><strong>CVE-2021-27861</strong>\nLayer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using LLC/SNAP headers with invalid length (and optionally VLAN0 headers).</p>\n<p><strong>CVE-2021-27862</strong>\nLayer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using LLC/SNAP headers with invalid length and Ethernet to Wifi frame conversion (and optionally VLAN0 headers).</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>An attacker can bypass security controls and deceive a locally connected target host to route traffic to arbitrary destinations.  Victim devices experience either a DoS (blackholing traffic) or MitM (observing the unencrypted traffic and maybe breaking encryption). </p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<h4 id=\"apply-updates\">Apply Updates</h4>\n<p>Install vendor-provided patches and updates to ensure malicious content is blocked or rejected by the security controls (such as RA Guard), thereby blocking router advertisements or other network configuration related advertisements that originate on host ports.</p>\n<h4 id=\"inspect-and-block-router-advertisements\">Inspect and Block Router Advertisements</h4>\n<p>Utilize the interface security controls on your router or managed switch to perform DHCP snooping, IPv6 RA guard, IP source guard, and ARP/ND inspection. It is also recommended to only allow needed protocol on access ports (ARP/ICMP/IPv4/IPv6), some applications may have additional needs so be prepared to modify the allow list as needed. </p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to Etienne Champetier for reporting this vulnerability. </p>\n<p>This document was written by Timur Snoke.</p>",

Two reasons: First, many customers don’t have an ongoing relationship with the hardware and software providers that protect their funds­&#8212;nor do they have an incentive to update security on a regular basis. Turning to a new security provider or using updated software creates risks; leaving everything the way it was feels safer. So users won’t be rushing to pay for and install new security patches...</p></blockquote>",
