These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the \"Date Added to Catalog\" column, which will sort by descending dates.      \nBinding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   \nAlthough BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.\nThis product is provided subject to this Notification and this Privacy & Use policy.",

          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>Multiple Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) implementations are vulnerable to code execution in System Management Mode (SMM) by an attacker who gains administrative privileges on the local machine. An attacker can corrupt the memory using Direct Memory Access (DMA) timing attacks that can lead to code execution. These threats are collectively referred to as RingHopper attacks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>The UEFI standard provides an open specification that defines a software interface between an operating system (OS) and the device hardware on the system.  UEFI can interface directly with hardware below the OS using SMM, a high-privilege CPU mode.  <a href=\"https://edk2-docs.gitbook.io/edk-ii-secure-coding-guide/secure_coding_guidelines_intel_platforms/smm\">SMM operations</a> are closely managed by the CPU using a dedicated portion of memory called the SMRAM.  The SMM can only be entered through System Management Interrupt (SMI) Handlers using a communication buffer.  SMI Handlers are essentially a system-call to access the CPU's SMRAM from its current operating mode, typically Protected Mode.</p>\n<p>A race condition involving the access and validation of the SMRAM can be achieved using DMA timing attacks that rely on time-of-use (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use\">TOCTOU</a>) conditions. An attacker can use well-timed probing to try and overwrite the contents of SMRAM with arbitrary data, leading to attacker code being executed with the same elevated-privileges available to the CPU (i.e., <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Mode\">Ring -2 mode</a>).  The asynchronous nature of SMRAM access via DMA controllers enables the attacker to perform such unauthorized access and bypass the verifications normally provided by the SMI Handler API.  </p>\n<p>The Intel-VT and Intel VT-d technologies provide some protection against DMA attacks using Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) to address DMA threats.  Although IOMMU can protect from DMA hardware attacks, SMI Handlers vulnerable to RingHopper may still be abused.  SMRAM verification involving <a href=\"https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/another-brick-in-the-wall-uncovering-smm-vulnerabilities-in-hp-firmware/\">validation of nested pointers</a> adds even more complexity when analyzing how various SMI Handlers are used in UEFI. </p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>An attacker with either local or remote administrative privileges can exploit DMA timing attacks to elevate privileges beyond the operating system and execute arbitrary code in SMM mode (Ring -2). These attacks can be invoked from the OS using vulnerable SMI Handlers.  In some cases, the vulnerabilities can be triggered in the UEFI early boot phases (as well as sleep and recovery) before the operating system is fully initialized.</p>\n<p>A successful attack enables any of the following impacts:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Invalidation or bypass of UEFI security features (SecureBoot, Intel BootGuard).</li>\n<li>Installation of persistent software that cannot be easily detected or erased.</li>\n<li>Creation of backdoors and back communications channels to exfiltrate sensitive data</li>\n<li>Interruption of system execution leading to permanent shutdown.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Because these attacks are against UEFI supported firmware, OS and EDR solutions may have diminished visibility into unauthorized access.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>Install the latest stable version of UEFI firmware provided by your PC vendor or by the reseller of your computing environments. See the links below for resources and updates provided by specific vendors to address these issues.  </p>\n<p>If your operating system supports automatic or managed updates for firmware, such as Linux Vendor Firmware Service (<a href=\"https://fwupd.org/lvfs/docs/users\">LVFS</a>), check (<code>fwupdmgr get-updates</code>) and apply the firmware updates provided by LVFS using <code>fwupdmgr update</code> as appropriate. </p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to the Intel iStare researchers Jonathan Lusky  and Benny Zeltser who discovered and reported this vulnerability. </p>\n<p>This document was written by Vijay Sarvepalli.</p>",

These vulnerabilities were introduced in version 3.0.0 with the inclusion of support for punycode email address parsing for X.509 certificates.   OpenSSL's assessment of the severity of the vulnerabilities has <a href=\"https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2022/11/01/email-address-overflows/\">reduced from CRITICAL to HIGH</a>, and OpenSSL 3.0.7 addresses the issues.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>Two buffer overflows have been reported in the OpenSSL 3.0.x branch prior to version 3.0.7 that, when exploited, may lead to denial of services or, in some cases, remote code execution in the vulnerable target environment. OpenSSL client and server implementations that use the vulnerable libraries are affected.  The server implementation also requires that <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4346#appendix-F.1.1\">TLS client authentication</a> is enabled in order to attack, and potentially exploit, a vulnerable target.   <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/FiloSottile/611fc3fa95c3aceebf2580983f76148c\">OpenSSL provides details:</a> </p>\n<pre><code>* Fixed two buffer overflows in punycode decoding functions.\n\n   A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,\n   specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after\n   certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to\n   have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue\n   certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted\n   issuer.\n\n   In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious\n   server.  In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests\n   client authentication and a malicious client connects.\n\n   An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow\n   an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.`  character (decimal 46)\n   on the stack.

A local attacker could use this to cause a\ndenial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-2318)\n\nRoger Pau Monné discovered that the Xen virtual block driver in the Linux\nkernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared\ncommunication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-26365)\n\nRoger Pau Monné discovered that the Xen paravirtualization frontend in the\nLinux kernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared\ncommunication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose\nsensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-33740)\n\nIt was discovered that the Xen paravirtualization frontend in the Linux\nkernel incorrectly shared unrelated data when communicating with certain\nbackends. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory).\n(CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742)\n\nOleksandr Tyshchenko discovered that the Xen paravirtualization platform in\nthe Linux kernel on ARM platforms contained a race condition in certain\nsituations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of\nservice in the host OS. (CVE-2022-33744)",
