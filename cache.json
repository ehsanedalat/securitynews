This enables the cyber actor to blend in with routine Windows system and network activities, limit activity and data captured in default logging configurations, and avoid endpoint detection and response (EDR) products that could alert to the introduction of third-party applications on the host or network. Private sector partners have identified that this activity affects networks across U.S. critical infrastructure sectors, and the authoring agencies believe the actor could apply the same techniques against these and other sectors worldwide.\nThe authoring agencies have identified potential indicators associated with these techniques. To hunt for this activity, CISA and partners encourage network defenders to use the actor’s commands and detection signatures provided in this advisory. CISA and partners further encourage network defenders to view the indicators of compromise (IOCs) and mitigations summaries to detect this activity.",

The update incorporates lessons learned from the past two years and includes additional recommended actions, resources, and tools to maximize its relevancy and effectiveness and to further help reduce the prevalence and impacts of ransomware.\nThe #StopRansomware Guide serves as a one-stop resource to help organizations reduce the risk of ransomware incidents through best practices to detect, prevent, respond, and recover, including step-by-step approaches to address potential attacks. The authoring organizations recommend that entities review this joint guide to prepare and protect their facilities, personnel, and customers from the impacts of ransomware and data exfiltration. For more information and to access the latest resources about how to stop ransomware, please visit stopransomware.gov.\nThis joint guide was developed through the Joint Ransomware Task Force (JRTF), an interagency collaborative effort to reduce the prevalence and impact of ransomware attacks. JRTF was established by Congress in 2022 and is co-chaired by CISA and FBI. For additional information about the JRTF, please visit CISA's newly launched Joint Ransomware Task Force (JRTF) webpage.",

Instead, it released the code into the open-source community, and shortly thereafter the model itself was leaked. Researchers and programmers immediately started modifying it, improving it, and getting it to do things no one else anticipated. And their results have been immediate, innovative, and an indication of how the future of this technology is going to play out. Training speeds have hugely increased, and the size of the models themselves has shrunk to the point that you can create and run them on a laptop. The world of AI research has dramatically changed...</p>",
