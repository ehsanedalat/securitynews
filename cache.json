Rhysida actors leverage external-facing remote services, such as virtual private networks (VPNs), Zerologon vulnerability (CVE-2020-1472), and phishing campaigns to gain initial access and persistence within a network.\nCISA, FBI, and MS-ISAC encourage organizations review the joint CSA for recommended mitigations to reduce the likelihood and impact of Rhysida and other ransomware incidents.
