Threats from synthetic media, such as deepfakes, have exponentially increased—presenting a growing challenge for users of modern technology and communications, including the National Security Systems (NSS), the Department of Defense (DoD), the Defense Industrial Base (DIB), and national critical infrastructure owners and operators. Between 2021 and 2022, U.S. Government agencies collaborated to establish a set of employable best practices to take in preparation and response to the growing threat. Public concern around synthetic media includes disinformation operations, designed to influence the public and spread false information about political, social, military, or economic issues to cause confusion, unrest, and uncertainty.\nThe authoring agencies urge organizations review the CSI for recommended steps and best practices to prepare, identify, defend against, and respond to deepfake threats.\nTo report suspicious activity or possible incidents involving deepfakes, contact one of the following agencies:\nCybersecurity Report Feedback: CybersecurityReports@nsa.gov\nInternet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at IC3.gov or contact a local FBI field office\nCISA’s Incident Reporting System or through the agency’s 24/7 Operations Center at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870",

This CSA provides information on an incident at an Aeronautical Sector organization, with malicious activity occurring as early as January 2023. \nCISA, FBI, and CNMF confirmed that nation-state advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploited CVE-2022-47966 to gain unauthorized access to a public-facing application (Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus), establish persistence, and move laterally through the network. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution on the ManageEngine application. Additional APT actors were also observed exploiting CVE-2022-42475 to establish presence on the organization’s firewall device.\nThe authoring agencies urge organizations to review this CSA and implement the recommended mitigations, which align with CISA’s Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals (CPGs)—developed by CISA and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)—as well as NSA-recommended best practices for securing infrastructure.\nAll organizations should report suspicious or criminal activity related to information found in this joint Cybersecurity Advisory by contacting your local FBI field office and CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870.",

          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>Multiple BGP implementations have been identified as vulnerable to specially crafted Path Attributes of a BGP UPDATE. Instead of ignoring invalid updates they reset the underlying TCP connection for the BGP session and de-peer the router. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is undesirable because a session reset impacts not only routes with the BGP UPDATE but also the other valid routes exchanged over the session. <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7606#section-1\">RFC 7606 Introduction</a> </p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP, <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271\">RFC 4271</a>) is a widely used inter-Autonomous System routing protocol. BGP communication among peer routers is critical to the stable operation of the Internet. A number of known BGP security issues were addressed in <a href=\"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7606\">RFC 7606</a> <em>Revised Error Handling for BGP UPDATE Messages</em> in 2015. </p>\n<p>Recent reports indicate that multiple BGP implementations do not properly handle specially crafted Path Attributes in the BGP UPDATE messages. An attacker with a valid, configured BGP session could inject a specially crafted packet into an existing BGP session or the underlying TCP session (179/tcp). A vulnerable BGP implementation could drop sessions when processing crafted UPDATE messages. A persistent attack could lead to routing instability (route flapping).</p>\n<p>This vulnerability was first announced as affecting <a href=\"https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/7.3/common/006_bgpd.patch.sig\">OpenBSD</a> based routers. Further investigation indicates that other vendors are affected by the same or similar issues. Please see the <a href=\"#systems\">Systems Affected</a> section below.\nHere are the CVE IDs that were reserved by the reporter for different vendors that were tested:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-4481\">CVE-2023-4481</a> (Juniper)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38802\">CVE-2023-38802</a> (FRR)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38283\">CVE-2023-38283</a> (OpenBGPd)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-40457\">CVE-2023-40457</a> (EXOS)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>A remote attacker could publish a BGP UPDATE with a crafted set of Path Attributes, causing vulnerable routers to de-peer from any link from which such an update were received. Unaffected routers might also pass the crafted updates across the network, potentially leading to the update arriving at an affected router from multiple sources, causing multiple links to fail.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solutions for every vendor but some of the vendors allow you to change the response to errors in BGP path updates. Networks using appliances from Juniper and Nokia can mitigate this behavior by enabling:</p>\n<p><strong>(Juniper)</strong><br>\nset protocols bgp bgp-error-tolerance</p>\n<p><strong>(Nokia)</strong><br>\n[router bgp group]<br>\nerror-handling update-fault-tolerance</p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to the reporter Ben Cartwright-Cox.

An unauthenticated attacker could thereby gain access to sensitive information, such as the Administrative password, which could be used to launch additional attacks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>There is no known solution to the vulnerability.

In the evaluation process, a numeric score between 0 and 10 is calculated, 10 being the most severe (critical) value. The goal of CVSS is to provide comparable scores across different evaluators. However, previous works indicate that CVSS might not reach this goal: If a vulnerability is evaluated by several analysts, their scores often differ. This raises the following questions: Are CVSS evaluations consistent? Which factors influence CVSS assessments? We systematically investigate these questions in an online survey with 196 CVSS users. We show that specific CVSS metrics are inconsistently evaluated for widespread vulnerability types, including Top 3 vulnerabilities from the &#8221;2022 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses&#8221; list. In a follow-up survey with 59 participants, we found that for the same vulnerabilities from the main study, 68% of these users gave different severity ratings. Our study reveals that most evaluators are aware of the problematic aspects of CVSS, but they still see CVSS as a useful tool for vulnerability assessment. Finally, we discuss possible reasons for inconsistent evaluations and provide recommendations on improving the consistency of scoring...</p></blockquote>",
