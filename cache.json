In June 2023, threat actors exploited this vulnerability as a zero-day to drop a webshell on a critical infrastructure organization’s non-production environment NetScaler ADC appliance. The webshell enabled the actors to perform discovery on the victim’s active directory (AD) and collect and exfiltrate AD data. The actors attempted to move laterally to a domain controller but network-segmentation controls for the appliance blocked movement.\nThe victim organization…",

Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the \"Date Added to Catalog\" column—which will sort by descending dates.\nBinding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.\nAlthough BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice.

There existed a small window between verifying the signature and integrity of the update DLL and the execution of DLL main. </p>\n<p>By exploiting this race condition, a local attacker could swap out the officially signed Parsec DLL with a DLL that they created, which would subsequently be executed as the SYSTEM user as described in CVE-2023-37250.</p>\n<p><strong>CVE-2023-37250</strong>\nThe application launches DLLs from a User owned directory. Since the user owns both the DLL file and the directory, it is possible to (successfully) attempt tricking Parsec into loading an unsigned/arbitrary DLL file and execute its DllMain() method with SYSTEM privileges, creating a Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>By exploiting this race condition, a local attacker could swap out the officially signed Parsec DLL with a DLL that they created, which would subsequently be executed as the SYSTEM user.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>The vulnerability applies to a \"Per User\" installation as opposed to a \"Shared User\". There is an update that has been made available. To force an update, you can either completely quit, and re-open the application several times until the loader is updated (by confirming in the logs).

          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>urllib.parse is a very basic and widely used basic URL parsing function in various applications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>An issue in the urllib.parse component of Python before v3.11 allows attackers to bypass blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters.</p>\n<p>urlparse has a parsing problem when the entire URL starts with blank characters. This problem affects both the parsing of hostname and scheme, and eventually causes any blocklisting methods to fail.</p>\n<p><strong>URL Parsing Security</strong> *</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlsplit\" title=\"urllib.parse.urlsplit\"><code>urlsplit()</code></a> and <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlparse\" title=\"urllib.parse.urlparse\"><code>urlparse()</code></a> APIs do not perform <strong>validation</strong> of inputs. They may not raise errors on inputs that other applications consider invalid. They may also succeed on some inputs that might not be considered URLs elsewhere. Their purpose is for practical functionality rather than purity.</p>\n<p>Instead of raising an exception on unusual input, they may instead return some component parts as empty strings. Or components may contain more than perhaps they should.</p>\n<p>We recommend that users of these APIs where the values may be used anywhere with security implications code defensively. Do some verification within your code before trusting a returned component part. Does that <code>scheme</code> make sense? Is that a sensible <code>path</code>? Is there anything strange about that<code>hostname</code>? etc.</p>\n<p>What constitutes a URL is not universally well defined. Different applications have different needs and desired constraints. For instance the living <a href=\"https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-basic-url-parser\">WHATWG spec</a> describes what user facing web clients such as a web browser require. While <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986.html\"><strong>RFC 3986</strong></a> is more general. These functions incorporate some aspects of both, but cannot be claimed compliant with either. The APIs and existing user code with expectations on specific behaviors predate both standards leading us to be very cautious about making API behavior changes.</p>\n<p>*Note: This was added as part of the documentation update in https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/102508</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Due to this issue, attackers can bypass any domain or protocol filtering method implemented with a blocklist. Protocol filtering failures can lead to arbitrary file reads, arbitrary command execution, SSRF, and other problems. Failure of domain name filtering may lead to re-access of blocked bad or dangerous websites or to failure of CSRF referer type defense, etc.</p>\n<p>Because this vulnerability exists in the most basic parsing library, more advanced issues are possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>The fixes are in the following releases:\n</p><p>fixed in &gt;= 3.12\n<br>fixed in 3.11.x &gt;= 3.11.4\n<br>fixed in 3.10.x &gt;= 3.10.12\n<br>fixed in 3.9.x &gt;= 3.9.17\n<br>fixed in 3.8.x &gt;= 3.8.17\n<br>fixed in 3.7.x &gt;= 3.7.17</p><p></p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to the reporter, Yebo Cao for researching and reporting this vulnerability.</p>\n<p>This document was written by Ben Koo.</p>",

D-Link provides a software driver for Microsoft Windows operating system that enables proper operation of the device with the operating system.

Given certain conditions are met, there is potential for a local privilege escalation allowing an attacker to escalate privileges to local administrative user.</p>\n<p>The following conditions are required to trigger this bug\n* The software is installed in a directory with a space in it. (The default settings for directory will work)\n* An unprivileged user should have write access to the directory above the folder that contains the space in its name.

User identity is central to the vectors of attack and manipulation employed in these contexts. However it has long seemed that, try as it might, the security community has been unable to stem the rising tide of such problems. We posit the Ghost Trilemma, that there are three key properties of identity&#8212;sentience, location, and uniqueness&#8212;that cannot be simultaneously verified in a fully-decentralized setting. Many fully-decentralized systems&#8212;whether for communication or social coordination&#8212;grapple with this trilemma in some way, perhaps unknowingly. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK) paper, we examine the design space, use cases, problems with prior approaches, and possible paths forward. We sketch a proof of this trilemma and outline options for practical, incrementally deployable schemes to achieve an acceptable tradeoff of trust in centralized trust anchors, decentralized operation, and an ability to withstand a range of attacks, while protecting user privacy...</p></blockquote>",

This paper presents a practical implementation of a state-of-the-art deep learning model in order to classify laptop keystrokes, using a smartphone integrated microphone. When trained on keystrokes recorded by a nearby phone, the classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%, the highest accuracy seen without the use of a language model. When trained on keystrokes recorded using the video-conferencing software Zoom, an accuracy of 93% was achieved, a new best for the medium.
