QakBot—also known as Qbot, Quackbot, Pinkslipbot, and TA570—is responsible for thousands of malware infections globally. \nOriginally used as a banking trojan to steal banking credentials for account compromise, QakBot—in most cases—was delivered via phishing campaigns containing malicious attachments or links to download the malware, which would reside in memory once on the victim network. QakBot has since grown to deploy multiple types of malware, trojans, and highly-destructive ransomware variants targeting the United States and other global infrastructures, including the Election Infrastructure Subsector, Financial Services, Emergency Services, and Commercial Facilities Sectors. \nCISA and FBI urge organizations to implement the recommendations contained within the joint CSA to reduce the likelihood of QakBot-related activity and promote identification of QakBot-facilitated ransomware and malware infections. To report incidents and anomalous activity, please contact one of the following organizations:  \n\nCISA, either through the agency’s online tool (cisa.gov/report) or the 24/7 Operations Center at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870.  \nFBI via a local field office.  \nOrganizations are also encouraged to visit CISA's Malware, Phishing, and Ransomware and StopRansomware.gov pages—StopRansomware provides a range of free U.S. government resources and services that can help bolster cyber hygiene, cybersecurity posture and reduce risk to ransomware, and contains an updated Joint #StopRansomware Guide.",

          "description": "Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released its inaugural Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) Platform 2022 Annual Report, highlighting the service’s progress supporting vulnerability awareness and remediation across the Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB). This report showcases how agencies have used the VDP Platform—launched in July 2021—to safeguard the FCEB and support risk reduction. The VDP platform gives federal agencies a single, user-friendly interface to intake vulnerability information and to collaborate with the public researcher community for vulnerability awareness and remediation.\nCISA urges FCEB agencies to review the VDP Platform 2022 Annual Report and encourages use of the platform to promote good-faith security research if they are not already doing so. By promoting an agency’s VDP to the public security researcher community, the platform benefits users by harnessing researchers’ expertise to search for and detect vulnerabilities that traditional scanning technology might not find.\nCISA is actively seeking to enhance future collaborations with the public security researcher community and welcomes participation and partnership.",

          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>urllib.parse is a very basic and widely used basic URL parsing function in various applications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>An issue in the urllib.parse component of Python before v3.11 allows attackers to bypass blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters.</p>\n<p>urlparse has a parsing problem when the entire URL starts with blank characters. This problem affects both the parsing of hostname and scheme, and eventually causes any blocklisting methods to fail.</p>\n<p><strong>URL Parsing Security</strong> *</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlsplit\" title=\"urllib.parse.urlsplit\"><code>urlsplit()</code></a> and <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlparse\" title=\"urllib.parse.urlparse\"><code>urlparse()</code></a> APIs do not perform <strong>validation</strong> of inputs. They may not raise errors on inputs that other applications consider invalid. They may also succeed on some inputs that might not be considered URLs elsewhere. Their purpose is for practical functionality rather than purity.</p>\n<p>Instead of raising an exception on unusual input, they may instead return some component parts as empty strings. Or components may contain more than perhaps they should.</p>\n<p>We recommend that users of these APIs where the values may be used anywhere with security implications code defensively. Do some verification within your code before trusting a returned component part. Does that <code>scheme</code> make sense? Is that a sensible <code>path</code>? Is there anything strange about that<code>hostname</code>? etc.</p>\n<p>What constitutes a URL is not universally well defined. Different applications have different needs and desired constraints. For instance the living <a href=\"https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-basic-url-parser\">WHATWG spec</a> describes what user facing web clients such as a web browser require. While <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986.html\"><strong>RFC 3986</strong></a> is more general. These functions incorporate some aspects of both, but cannot be claimed compliant with either. The APIs and existing user code with expectations on specific behaviors predate both standards leading us to be very cautious about making API behavior changes.</p>\n<p>*Note: This was added as part of the documentation update in https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/102508</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Due to this issue, attackers can bypass any domain or protocol filtering method implemented with a blocklist. Protocol filtering failures can lead to arbitrary file reads, arbitrary command execution, SSRF, and other problems. Failure of domain name filtering may lead to re-access of blocked bad or dangerous websites or to failure of CSRF referer type defense, etc.</p>\n<p>Because this vulnerability exists in the most basic parsing library, more advanced issues are possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>The fixes are in the following releases:\n</p><p>fixed in &gt;= 3.12\n<br>fixed in 3.11.x &gt;= 3.11.4\n<br>fixed in 3.10.x &gt;= 3.10.12\n<br>fixed in 3.9.x &gt;= 3.9.17\n<br>fixed in 3.8.x &gt;= 3.8.17\n<br>fixed in 3.7.x &gt;= 3.7.17</p><p></p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to the reporter, Yebo Cao for researching and reporting this vulnerability.</p>\n<p>This document was written by Ben Koo.</p>",
