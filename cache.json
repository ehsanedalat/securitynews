Similar to the 2023 JCDC Planning Agenda, JCDC’s 2024 Priorities will help focus the collective group on developing high-impact and collaborative solutions to the most pressing cybersecurity challenges.\nResulting from the trusted partnerships the collaborative has fostered, the focused goals of the 2024 priorities are to:\nDefend against Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) operations.\nRaise critical infrastructure’s cybersecurity baseline.\nAnticipate emerging technology and risks.\nCISA encourages organizations to review JCDC’s 2024 Priorities and the related blog post by CISA Associate Director Clayton Romans. Visit CISA.gov/JCDC for more information on the work the collaborative is doing to secure cyberspace.",

          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>Kontrol and Elock locks are electronic locks that utilize firmware provided by Sciener. This firmware works in tandem with an app, called the TTLock app, which is also produced by Sciener. The TTLock app utilizes Bluetooth connections to connect to locks that utilize the Sciener firmware, and allows for manipulation of the lock. Sceiner firmware locks also supports peripherals. The GatewayG2, also produced by Sciener, allows for connection to an appropriate lock through the TTLock app through WiFi. Sciener firmware also allows wireless keypad connection to supported devices. </p>\n<p>Analysis has revealed that the Kontrol and Elock locks are vulnerable through the Sciener firmware. Vulnerabilities within the TTLock App and GatewayG2 can be further utilized to compromise the associated electronic lock integrity. While Elock locks are vulnerable to attacks through the Sciener firmware, the Kontrol Lux lock, a specific lock model, has wireless vulnerabilities unique to it.</p>\n<p>A number of these vulnerabilities are facilitated through the unlockKey character. The unlockKey character, when provided to the appropriate lock, can be used to unlock or lock the device. </p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>The vulnerabilities are as follows:</p>\n<p>•   CVE-2023-7006</p>\n<p>The unlockKey character in a lock using Sciener firmware can be brute forced through repeated challenge requests, compromising the locks integrity. Challenge requests take place during the unlocking process, and contain a random integer between 0 and 65535. Challenge requests can be repeatedly prompted and responded to without any limitations, until the correct integer is discovered. Successfully completing the challenge request provides the unlockKey character.</p>\n<p>•   CVE-2023-7005</p>\n<p>A specially crafted message can be sent to the TTLock App that downgrades the encryption protocol used for communication and can be utilized to compromise the lock, such as by providing the unlockKey character. During the challenge request process, if a message is sent to the lock unencrypted, and with a specific set of information, the corresponding message that contains the unlockKey character will be provided unencrypted. </p>\n<p>•   CVE-2023-7003</p>\n<p>The AES key utilized in the pairing process between a lock using Sciener firmware and a wireless keypad is not unique, and can be reused compromise other locks using the Sciener firmware. This AES key can be utilized to connect to any other Sciener lock that supports wireless keypads, without user knowledge or interaction. </p>\n<p>•   CVE-2023-6960</p>\n<p>The TTLock App supports the creation of virtual keys and settings. They virtual keys are intended to be distributed to other individuals through the TTLock app, for unlocking and locking the lock. They can also be set to only be valid for a certain period of time. Deletion of these keys only occurs client side in the TTLock app, with the appropriate key information persisting within the associated lock. If an attacker acquires one of these keys, they can utilize it to unlock the lock after its intended deletion or invalidation. </p>\n<p>•   CVE-2023-7004</p>\n<p>The TTLock App does not employ proper verification procedures to ensure that it is communicating with the expected device. This can be utilized by a threat actor who introduces a device that spoofs the MAC address of the lock, allowing for compromise of the unlockKey value.</p>\n<p>•   CVE-2023-7007</p>\n<p>The Sciener server does not validate connection requests from the GatewayG2, allowing an impersonation attack. An attacker can impersonate the MAC address of a GatewayG2 that has established a connection with a lock, then connect to Sciener servers and receive messages instead of the legitimate GatewayG2. This can facilitate access of the unlockKey character. </p>\n<p>•   CVE-2023-7009</p>\n<p>The Kontrol Lux lock supports plaintext message processing over Bluetooth Low Energy, allowing unencrypted malicious commands to be passed to the lock. These malicious commands, less then 16 bytes in length, will be processed by the lock as if they were encrypted communications. This can be further exploited by an attacker to compromise the locks integrity. </p>\n<p>•   CVE-2023-7017</p>\n<p>The Kontrol Lux lock firmware update mechanism does not authenticate or validate firmware updates if passed to the lock through the Bluetooth Low Energy service. A challenge request can be sent to the lock with a command to prepare for an update, rather than an unlock request. This allows an attacker within Bluetooth range to pass an arbitrary malicious firmware to the lock, compromising its integrity. </p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>These vulnerabilities allow attackers with physical, adjacent, or Bluetooth connection proximity to the lock access of various capabilities to compromise the lock integrity, without victim knowledge or interaction. This results in the locks functionality being null. </p>\n<p>Affected versions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Kontrol Lux lock, firmware versions 6.5.x to 6.5.07</li>\n<li>Gateway G2, firmware version 6.0.0</li>\n<li>TTLock App, version 6.4.5</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>There is no software solution for these vulnerabilities, only a potential work-around. By disabling various functions related to the Bluetooth capability of locks using Sciener firmware, several of the attacks can be prevented. However, as the locks are designed with the intention of utilization with the TTLock App, this may not be a practical solution for most users.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to Lev Aronsky, Idan Strovinsky, and Tomer Telem of Aleph Research for providing the report and information.

These deployments are vulnerable to prompt injection and jailbreaking (collectively, prompt hacking), in which models are manipulated to ignore their original instructions and follow potentially malicious ones. Although widely acknowledged as a significant security threat, there is a dearth of large-scale resources and quantitative studies on prompt hacking. To address this lacuna, we launch a global prompt hacking competition, which allows for free-form human input attacks. We elicit 600K+ adversarial prompts against three state-of-the-art LLMs. We describe the dataset, which empirically verifies that current LLMs can indeed be manipulated via prompt hacking. We also present a comprehensive taxonomical ontology of the types of adversarial prompts...</p></blockquote>",

The mathematics of cryptanalysis for these lattice and other systems is still rapidly evolving, and we&#8217;re likely to break more of them&#8212;and learn a lot in the process&#8212;over the coming few years. But if you&#8217;re going to make the switch, this is an excellent choice. And Apple&#8217;s ability to do this so efficiently speaks well about its algorithmic agility, which is probably more important than its particular cryptographic design. And it is probably about the right time to worry about, and defend against, attackers who are storing encrypted messages in hopes of breaking them later on future quantum computers...</p>",

As a result, these LLMs can now function autonomously as agents. With the rise in capabilities of these agents, recent work has speculated on how LLM agents would affect cybersecurity. However, not much is known about the offensive capabilities of LLM agents.</p>\n<p>In this work, we show that LLM agents can autonomously hack websites, performing tasks as complex as blind database schema extraction and SQL injections without human feedback. Importantly, the agent does not need to know the vulnerability beforehand. This capability is uniquely enabled by frontier models that are highly capable of tool use and leveraging extended context. Namely, we show that GPT-4 is capable of such hacks, but existing open-source models are not. Finally, we show that GPT-4 is capable of autonomously finding vulnerabilities in websites in the wild. Our findings raise questions about the widespread deployment of LLMs...</p></blockquote>",
