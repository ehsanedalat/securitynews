The Symantec Threat Hunter team, part of Broadcom Software, worked with CISA to engage with multiple governments targeted with Daxin malware and assisted in detection and remediation.\nDaxin malware is a highly sophisticated rootkit backdoor with complex, stealthy command and control (C2) functionality that enabled remote actors to communicate with secured devices not connected directly to the internet. Daxin appears to be optimized for use against hardened targets, allowing the actors to deeply burrow into targeted networks and exfiltrate data without raising suspicions.  \nCISA urges organizations to review Daxin: Stealthy Backdoor Designed for Attacks Against Hardened Networks for more information and for a list of indicators of compromise that may aid in the detection of this activity.\nReport incidents related to this activity to CISA and/or the FBI via your local FBI field office or the FBI’s 24/7 CyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov.\nThis product is provided subject to this Notification and this Privacy & Use policy.",

          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>The InsydeH2O Hardware-2-Operating System (H2O) UEFI firmware contains multiple vulnerabilities related to memory management in System Management Mode (SMM). </p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>UEFI software provides an extensible interface between an operating system and platform firmware.  UEFI software uses a highly privileged processor execution mode called System Management Mode (SMM) for handling system-wide functions like power management, system hardware control, or proprietary OEM-designed code.  SMM's privileges, also referred to as \"Ring -2,\" exceed the privileges of the operating system's kernel (\"Ring-0\").  For this reason, SMM is executed in a protected area of memory called the SMRAM.  It is typically accessed via System Management Interrupt (SMI) Handlers using communication buffers, which are also known as \"SMM Comm Buffers.\"  The SMM also provides protection against SPI flash modifications and performs boot time verifications similar to those performed by <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/SecureBoot#What_is_UEFI_Secure_Boot.3F\">SecureBoot</a>.</p>\n<p>UEFI software requires both openness (for hardware drivers, pluggable devices and Driver eXecution Environment (DXE) updates) as well as very tight security controls (for e.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/tianocore-docs/Docs/raw/master/White_Papers/A_Tour_Beyond_BIOS_Secure_SMM_Communication.pdf\">SMM Comm Buffer Security</a>), making it a complex software that needs a thorough set of security controls that need validation throughout the software's lifecycle.  UEFI also supports recent capabilities like Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) for virtualization and the increasing demand of virtual computing resources. </p>\n<p>Insyde's H2O UEFI firmware contains several (23) memory management vulnerabilities that were disclosed by <a href=\"https://www.binarly.io\">Binarly</a>.  While these vulnerabilities were discovered in  <a href=\"https://www.fujitsu.com/global/\">Fujitsu</a> and <a href=\"https://atos.net/en/\">Bull Atos</a> implementations of Insyde H2O software, the same software is also present in many other vendor implementations due to the complex UEFI supply chain.  The vulnerabilities can be classified by the following <a href=\"https://medium.com/firmware-threat-hunting/uefi-vulnerabilities-classification-4897596e60af\">UEFI vulnerability categories</a>.</p>\n<table><thead><tr><td>Vulnerability Category</td> <td>Count </td>\n    </tr>\n    </thead><thead>\n        </thead><tbody>\n            <tr>\n                <td>SMM Privilege Escalation</td><td> 10 </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td> SMM Memory Corruption </td> <td>12 </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td> DXE Memory Corruption </td><td>1</td>\n                </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>The impacts of these vulnerabilities vary widely due to the nature of SMM capabilities. As an example, a local attacker with administrative privileges (or a remote attacker with administrative privileges)  can exploit these vulnerabilities to elevate privileges above the operating system to execute arbitrary code in SMM mode.    These attacks can be invoked  from the operating system using the unverified or unsafe SMI Handlers, and in some cases these bugs can also be triggered in the UEFI early boot phases ( as well as sleep and recovery like <a href=\"https://uefi.org/acpi\">ACPI</a>) before the operating system is initialized. </p>\n<p>In summary, a local attacker with administrative privileges (in some cases a remote attacker with administrative privileges)  can use malicious software to perform any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Invalidate many hardware security features (SecureBoot, Intel <a href=\"https://edk2-docs.gitbook.io/understanding-the-uefi-secure-boot-chain/secure_boot_chain_in_uefi/intel_boot_guard\">BootGuard</a>)</li>\n<li>Install persistent software that cannot be easily erased</li>\n<li>Create backdoors and back communications channels to exfiltrate sensitive data</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>Install the latest stable version of firmware provided by your PC vendor or your nearest reseller of your computing environments.  See the links below to resources and updates provided by specific vendors.  </p>\n<p>If your operating system supports automatic or managed updates for firmware, such as <a href=\"https://fwupd.org/\">Linux Vendor Firmware Service</a> (LVFS), apply the related software security updates.  Binarly has also provided a set of UEFI software detection rules called <a href=\"https://github.com/binarly-io/FwHunt/tree/main/rules\">FwHunt rules</a> to assist with identifying vulnerable software.  LVFS applies these FwHunt rules to detect and support the fix of firmware updates that are impacted by this advisory.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>The efiXplorer team of Binarly researched and reported these vulnerabilities to Insyde Software.

Ransomware encrypts data and demands a ransom in exchange for decryption. As data recovery is impossible if the encryption key is not obtained, some companies suffer from considerable damage, such as the payment of huge amounts of money or the loss of important data. In this paper, we analyzed Hive ransomware, which appeared in June 2021. Hive ransomware has caused immense harm, leading the FBI to issue an alert about it. To minimize the damage caused by Hive Ransomware and to help victims recover their files, we analyzed Hive Ransomware and studied recovery methods. By analyzing the encryption process of Hive ransomware, we confirmed that vulnerabilities exist by using their own encryption algorithm. We have recovered the master key for generating the file encryption key partially, to enable the decryption of data encrypted by Hive ransomware. We recovered 95% of the master key without the attacker&#8217;s RSA private key and decrypted the actual infected data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt at decrypting Hive ransomware. It is expected that our method can be used to reduce the damage caused by Hive ransomware...</p></blockquote>",

It&#8217;s simply not true that this legislation puts user privacy and security at risk. In fact, it&#8217;s fairer to say that this legislation puts those companies&#8217; extractive business-models at risk. Their claims about risks to privacy and security are both false and disingenuous, and motivated by their own self-interest and not the public interest. App store monopolies cannot protect users from every risk, and they frequently prevent the distribution of important tools that actually enhance security. Furthermore, the alleged risks of third-party app stores and &#8220;side-loading&#8221; apps pale in comparison to their benefits. These bills will encourage competition, prevent monopolist extortion, and guarantee users a new right to digital self-determination...</p></blockquote>",
