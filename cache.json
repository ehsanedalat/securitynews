Multiple services and apps are affected by this backend vulnerability. A list of known vendors is included below. </p>\n<p>For more information and a detailed account of the flaw and investigation, please see \"<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/22/stalkerware-network-spilling-data/\">Behind the stalkerware network spilling the private phone data of hundreds of thousands</a>.\" </p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>An unauthenticated remote attacker can access personal information collected from any device with one of the stalkerware variants installed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>We are unaware of a practical solution to this problem.

Other types of bank transfers or transactions involving payment cards typically take at least a day to clear. But once crooks scare or trick victims into handing over money via Zelle, they can siphon away thousands of dollars in seconds. There’s no way for customers &#8212; and in many cases, the banks themselves &#8212; to retrieve the money.</p>\n<p>[&#8230;]</p>\n<p>It’s not clear who is legally liable for such losses. Banks say that returning money to defrauded customers is not their responsibility, since the federal law covering electronic transfers &#8212; known in the industry as Regulation E ­&#8211; requires them to cover only &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; transactions, and the fairly common scam that Mr. Faunce fell prey to tricks people into making the transfers themselves.

We reversed-engineered and provide a detailed description of the cryptographic design and code structure, and we unveil severe design flaws. We present an IV reuse attack on AES-GCM that allows an attacker to extract hardware-protected key material, and a downgrade attack that makes even the latest Samsung devices vulnerable to the IV reuse attack. We demonstrate working key extraction attacks on the latest devices. We also show the implications of our attacks on two higher-level cryptographic protocols between the TrustZone and a remote server: we demonstrate a working FIDO2 WebAuthn login bypass and a compromise of Google&#8217;s Secure Key Import...</p></blockquote>",

Ransomware encrypts data and demands a ransom in exchange for decryption. As data recovery is impossible if the encryption key is not obtained, some companies suffer from considerable damage, such as the payment of huge amounts of money or the loss of important data. In this paper, we analyzed Hive ransomware, which appeared in June 2021. Hive ransomware has caused immense harm, leading the FBI to issue an alert about it. To minimize the damage caused by Hive Ransomware and to help victims recover their files, we analyzed Hive Ransomware and studied recovery methods. By analyzing the encryption process of Hive ransomware, we confirmed that vulnerabilities exist by using their own encryption algorithm. We have recovered the master key for generating the file encryption key partially, to enable the decryption of data encrypted by Hive ransomware. We recovered 95% of the master key without the attacker&#8217;s RSA private key and decrypted the actual infected data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt at decrypting Hive ransomware. It is expected that our method can be used to reduce the damage caused by Hive ransomware...</p></blockquote>",
