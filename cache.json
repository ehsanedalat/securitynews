Until now, it has been a heavy lift for many targeted organizations, especially those with limited resources. CISA’s LME is a turnkey solution for public and private organizations seeking to strengthen their cybersecurity while reducing their log management burden.\nAs CISA’s newest shared services product offering, LME builds upon the success of the NCSC's log management solution, which was decommissioned in March 2023. CISA urges organizations to secure their Windows-based devices today by downloading the free LME technical solution.",

The hardest labor generally happens at night, from 5 P.M. until 7 A.M. Hundreds of bowling-ball-size light bulbs hang on racks on both sides of the vessel, enticing the squid up from the depths.
