These vulnerabilities affect certain versions of VMware Workspace ONE Access, VMware Identity Manager (vIDM), VMware vRealize Automation (vRA), VMware Cloud Foundation, and vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager. Exploiting these vulnerabilities permits malicious actors to trigger a server-side template injection that may result in remote code execution (RCE) (CVE-2022-22954) or escalation of privileges to root (CVE-2022-22960). \nVMware released updates for both vulnerabi…",

After installing May 10, 2022 rollup update on domain controllers, organizations might experience authentication failures on the server or client for services, such as Network Policy Server (NPS), Routing and Remote access Service (RRAS), Radius, Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), and Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP). Microsoft notified CISA of this issue, which is related to how the mapping of certificates to machine accounts is being handled by the domain controller.\nFor more information see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article, KB5014754—Certificate-based authentication changes on Windows domain controllers: Key Distribution Center registry key.\nNote: installation of updates released May 10, 2022, on client Windows devices and non-domain controller Windows Servers will not cause this issue and is still strongly encouraged.

          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>The uClibc and uClibc-ng libraries are vulnerable to DNS cache poisoning due to the use of predicatble DNS transaction IDs when making DNS requests.  This vulnerability can allow an attacker to perform DNS cache poisoning attacks against a vulnerable environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>The uClibc and the Uclibc-ng software are lightweight C standard libraries intended for use in embedded systems and mobile devices. The <a href=\"https://uclibc.org/\">uClibc</a> library has not been updated since May of 2012.  The newer  <a href=\"https://uclibc-ng.org/\">uClibc-ng </a>is the currently maintained fork of uClibc, as announced on the OpenWRT mailing list in July 2014. </p>\n<p>Researchers at the Nozomi Networks Security Research Team discovered that all existing versions of uClibc and uClibc-ng libraries are vulnerable to DNS cache poisoning.  These libraries do not employ any randomization in the DNS Transaction ID (DNS TXID) field when creating a new DNS request.  This can allow an attacker to send maliciously crafted DNS packets to corrupt the DNS cache with invalid entries and redirect users to arbitrary sites.  As uClibc and uClibc-ng are used in devices such as home routers and firewalls, an attacker can perform attacks against multiple users in a shared network environment that relies on DNS responses from the vulnerable device. </p>\n<p>The DNS cache poisoning scenarios and defenses are discussed in <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5452\">IETF RFC5452</a>.   </p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>The lack of DNS response validation can allow an attacker to use unsolicited DNS responses to poison the DNS cache and redirect users to malicious sites.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<h4 id=\"develop-and-apply-updates\">Develop and apply updates</h4>\n<p>If your vendor has developed a patched version of software to address this issue, apply the updates provided by your vendor.  If you have a forked or customized version of uClibc or uClibc-ng, develop a patch to ensure the <code>dns_lookup</code> function provides adequate randomization of DNS TXID's while making DNS requests.</p>\n<h4 id=\"follow-security-best-practices\">Follow security best practices</h4>\n<p>Consider the following security best-practices to protect DNS infrastructure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevent direct exposure of IoT devices and lightweight devices over the Internet to minimize attacks against a caching DNS server.</li>\n<li>Provide secure DNS recursion service with features such as DNSSEC validation and the interim <a href=\"https://astrolavos.gatech.edu/articles/increased_dns_resistance.pdf\">0x20-bit encoding</a> as part of enterprise DNS recursion services where applicable.</li>\n<li>Implement a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_default\">Secure By Default </a> configuration suitable for your operating environment (e.g., disable caching on embedded IoT devices when an upstream caching resolver is available).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to the Nozomi Networks Security Research Team for this <a href=\"https://www.nozominetworks.com/blog/nozomi-networks-discovers-unpatched-dns-bug-in-popular-c-standard-library-putting-iot-at-risk/\">report</a></p>\n<p>This document was written by Vijay Sarvepalli and Timur Snoke.</p>",

Many expect cyber operations to provide independent utility in both warfare and low-intensity competition. Underlying these expectations are broadly shared assumptions that information technology increases operational effectiveness. But a growing body of research shows how cyber operations tend to fall short of their promise. The reason for this shortfall is their subversive mechanism of action. In theory, subversion provides a way to exert influence at lower risks than force because it is secret and indirect, exploiting systems to use them against adversaries. The mismatch between promise and practice is the consequence of the subversive trilemma of cyber operations, whereby speed, intensity, and control are negatively correlated. These constraints pose a trilemma for actors because a gain in one variable tends to produce losses across the other two variables. A case study of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict provides empirical support for the argument. Qualitative analysis leverages original data from field interviews, leaked documents, forensic evidence, and local media. Findings show that the subversive trilemma limited the strategic utility of all five major disruptive cyber operations in this conflict...</p></blockquote>",

          "description": "<p>Georgetown has a <a href=\"https://americandragnet.org/\">new report</a> on the highly secretive bulk surveillance activities of ICE in the US:</p>\n<blockquote><p>When you think about government surveillance in the United States, you likely think of the National Security Agency or the FBI. You might even think of a powerful police agency, such as the New York Police Department. But unless you or someone you love has been targeted for deportation, you probably don&#8217;t immediately think of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>\n<p>This report argues that you should. Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE&#8217;s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government&#8217;s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has &#8212; without any judicial, legislative or public oversight &#8212; reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver&#8217;s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</p></blockquote>",

          "description": "<p>Apple Mail now <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/story/apple-mail-blocks-email-tracking-heres-what-it-means/\">blocks</a> email trackers by default.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Most email newsletters you get include an invisible &#8220;image,&#8221; typically a single white pixel, with a unique file name. The server keeps track of every time this &#8220;image&#8221; is opened and by which IP address. This quirk of internet history means that marketers can track exactly when you open an email and your IP address, which can be used to roughly work out your location.</p>\n<p>So, how does Apple Mail stop this? By caching. Apple Mail downloads all images for all emails before you open them. Practically speaking, that means every message downloaded to Apple Mail is marked &#8220;read,&#8221; regardless of whether you open it. Apples also routes the download through two different proxies, meaning your precise location also can&#8217;t be tracked...</p></blockquote>",
