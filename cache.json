Multiple services and apps are affected by this backend vulnerability. A list of known vendors is included below. </p>\n<p>For more information and a detailed account of the flaw and investigation, please see \"<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/22/stalkerware-network-spilling-data/\">Behind the stalkerware network spilling the private phone data of hundreds of thousands</a>.\" </p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>An unauthenticated remote attacker can access personal information collected from any device with one of the stalkerware variants installed.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>We are unaware of a practical solution to this problem. The infrastructure provider (according to the <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/22/stalkerware-network-spilling-data/\">TechCrunch investigation</a>, 1Byte Software), would need to address the IDOR vulnerability. </p>\n<p>For advice on detecting and removing stalkerware apps, see \"<a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/22/remove-android-spyware/\">Your Android phone could have stalkerware, here's how to remove it</a>.\" As noted by TechCrunch:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before you proceed, have a safety plan in place. The <a href=\"https://stopstalkerware.org/information-for-survivors/\">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a> offers advice and guidance for victims and survivors of stalkerware. Spyware is designed to be covert, but keep in mind that removing the spyware from your phone will likely alert the person who planted it, which could create an unsafe situation.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to Zack Whittaker from TechCrunch for researching and reporting this vulnerability and investigating the wider security concerns related to stalkerware.</p>\n<p>This document was written by James Stanley and Art Manion.</p>",

Consequently, the Agency may be facing a higher-than-necessary risk to its unclassified systems and data. While NASA&#8217;s exclusion of unclassified systems from its insider threat program is common among federal agencies, adding those systems to a multi-faceted security program could provide an additional level of maturity to the program and better protect agency resources. According to Agency officials, expanding the insider threat program to unclassified systems would benefit the Agency&#8217;s cybersecurity posture if incremental improvements, such as focusing on IT systems and people at the most risk, were  implemented. However, on-going concerns including staffing challenges, technology resource limitations, and lack of funding to support such an expansion would need to be addressed prior to enhancing the existing program...</p></blockquote>",

Ransomware encrypts data and demands a ransom in exchange for decryption. As data recovery is impossible if the encryption key is not obtained, some companies suffer from considerable damage, such as the payment of huge amounts of money or the loss of important data. In this paper, we analyzed Hive ransomware, which appeared in June 2021. Hive ransomware has caused immense harm, leading the FBI to issue an alert about it. To minimize the damage caused by Hive Ransomware and to help victims recover their files, we analyzed Hive Ransomware and studied recovery methods. By analyzing the encryption process of Hive ransomware, we confirmed that vulnerabilities exist by using their own encryption algorithm. We have recovered the master key for generating the file encryption key partially, to enable the decryption of data encrypted by Hive ransomware. We recovered 95% of the master key without the attacker&#8217;s RSA private key and decrypted the actual infected data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt at decrypting Hive ransomware. It is expected that our method can be used to reduce the damage caused by Hive ransomware...</p></blockquote>",

          "description": "<p>A Berlin-based company has <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2022/02/22/apple_airtags_protections_bypass/\">developed</a> an AirTag clone that bypasses Apple&#8217;s anti-stalker security systems. Source code for these AirTag clones is available online.</p>\n<p>So now we have several problems with the system. Apple&#8217;s anti-stalker security only works with iPhones. (Apple wrote an Android app that can detect AirTags, but how many people are going to download it?) And now non-AirTags can piggyback on Apple&#8217;s system without triggering the alarms.</p>\n<p>Apple didn&#8217;t think this through nearly as well as it claims to have. I think the general problem is one that I have ...</p>",

Such a shift is momentous but not without precedent. From the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 to the Clean Air Act of 1963 and the public-private revolution in airline safety in the 1990s, the United States has made important adjustments following profound changes in the economy and technology...</p></blockquote>",
