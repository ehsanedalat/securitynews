          "description": "Today, CISA issued Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 23-02: Mitigating the Risk from Internet-Exposed Management Interfaces, requiring Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to reduce risks posed by internet-exposed networked management interfaces on federal information systems. This Directive applies to dedicated device interfaces that are accessible over network protocols and are meant exclusively for authorized users to perform administrative activities on a device, a group of devices, or the network itself. \nAgencies must be prepared to remove identified networked management interfaces from exposure to the internet, or protect them with Zero-Trust capabilities that implement a policy enforcement point separate from the interface itself. CISA will monitor and support agency adherence, providing additional resources as needed. FCEB agencies should contact CISA at cyberdirectives@cisa.dhs.gov for additional information.\nWhile BOD 23-02 strictly applies to FCEB agencies, this threat extends to every sector. CISA recommends all stakeholders review and adopt this guidance.",

While this problem has classically been studied in security literature, recent advances in generative models have led to a shared interest among security and machine learning researchers in developing scalable steganography techniques. In this work, we show that a steganography procedure is perfectly secure under Cachin (1998)&#8217;s information theoretic-model of steganography if and only if it is induced by a coupling. Furthermore, we show that, among perfectly secure procedures, a procedure is maximally efficient if and only if it is induced by a minimum entropy coupling. These insights yield what are, to the best of our knowledge, the first steganography algorithms to achieve perfect security guarantees with non-trivial efficiency; additionally, these algorithms are highly scalable. To provide empirical validation, we compare a minimum entropy coupling-based approach to three modern baselines&#8212;arithmetic coding, Meteor, and adaptive dynamic grouping&#8212;using GPT-2, WaveRNN, and Image Transformer as communication channels. We find that the minimum entropy coupling-based approach achieves superior encoding efficiency, despite its stronger security constraints. In aggregate, these results suggest that it may be natural to view information-theoretic steganography through the lens of minimum entropy coupling...</p></blockquote>",

It should also help the wider community avoid similar attacks in the future. In pursuit of these goals, technical practitioners are increasingly influenced by stakeholders like cyber insurers and lawyers. This paper explores these impacts via a multi-stage, mixed methods research design that involved 69 expert interviews, data on commercial relationships, and an online validation workshop. The first stage of our study established 11 stylized facts that describe how cyber insurance sends work to a small numbers of IR firms, drives down the fee paid, and appoints lawyers to direct technical investigators. The second stage showed that lawyers when directing incident response often: introduce legalistic contractual and communication steps that slow-down incident response; advise IR practitioners not to write down remediation steps or to produce formal reports; and restrict access to any documents produced...</p></blockquote>",
