The VDP platform gives federal agencies a single, user-friendly interface to intake vulnerability information and to collaborate with the public researcher community for vulnerability awareness and remediation.\nCISA urges FCEB agencies to review the VDP Platform 2022 Annual Report and encourages use of the platform to promote good-faith security research if they are not already doing so. By promoting an agency’s VDP to the public security researcher community, the platform benefits users by harnessing researchers’ expertise to search for and detect vulnerabilities that traditional scanning technology might not find.\nCISA is actively seeking to enhance future collaborations with the public security researcher community and welcomes participation and partnership.",

There existed a small window between verifying the signature and integrity of the update DLL and the execution of DLL main. </p>\n<p>By exploiting this race condition, a local attacker could swap out the officially signed Parsec DLL with a DLL that they created, which would subsequently be executed as the SYSTEM user as described in CVE-2023-37250.</p>\n<p><strong>CVE-2023-37250</strong>\nThe application launches DLLs from a User owned directory. Since the user owns both the DLL file and the directory, it is possible to (successfully) attempt tricking Parsec into loading an unsigned/arbitrary DLL file and execute its DllMain() method with SYSTEM privileges, creating a Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>By exploiting this race condition, a local attacker could swap out the officially signed Parsec DLL with a DLL that they created, which would subsequently be executed as the SYSTEM user.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>The vulnerability applies to a \"Per User\" installation as opposed to a \"Shared User\". There is an update that has been made available. To force an update, you can either completely quit, and re-open the application several times until the loader is updated (by confirming in the logs). Or you can download a special installer that only updates the files inside of the program files that can be downloaded from https://builds.parsec.app/package/parsec-update-executables.exe.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to the reporter, Julian Horoszkiewicz.This document was written by Timur Snoke.</p>",

          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>urllib.parse is a very basic and widely used basic URL parsing function in various applications.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>An issue in the urllib.parse component of Python before v3.11 allows attackers to bypass blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters.</p>\n<p>urlparse has a parsing problem when the entire URL starts with blank characters. This problem affects both the parsing of hostname and scheme, and eventually causes any blocklisting methods to fail.</p>\n<p><strong>URL Parsing Security</strong> *</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlsplit\" title=\"urllib.parse.urlsplit\"><code>urlsplit()</code></a> and <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlparse\" title=\"urllib.parse.urlparse\"><code>urlparse()</code></a> APIs do not perform <strong>validation</strong> of inputs. They may not raise errors on inputs that other applications consider invalid. They may also succeed on some inputs that might not be considered URLs elsewhere. Their purpose is for practical functionality rather than purity.</p>\n<p>Instead of raising an exception on unusual input, they may instead return some component parts as empty strings. Or components may contain more than perhaps they should.</p>\n<p>We recommend that users of these APIs where the values may be used anywhere with security implications code defensively. Do some verification within your code before trusting a returned component part. Does that <code>scheme</code> make sense? Is that a sensible <code>path</code>? Is there anything strange about that<code>hostname</code>? etc.</p>\n<p>What constitutes a URL is not universally well defined. Different applications have different needs and desired constraints. For instance the living <a href=\"https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-basic-url-parser\">WHATWG spec</a> describes what user facing web clients such as a web browser require. While <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986.html\"><strong>RFC 3986</strong></a> is more general. These functions incorporate some aspects of both, but cannot be claimed compliant with either. The APIs and existing user code with expectations on specific behaviors predate both standards leading us to be very cautious about making API behavior changes.</p>\n<p>*Note: This was added as part of the documentation update in https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/102508</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Due to this issue, attackers can bypass any domain or protocol filtering method implemented with a blocklist. Protocol filtering failures can lead to arbitrary file reads, arbitrary command execution, SSRF, and other problems. Failure of domain name filtering may lead to re-access of blocked bad or dangerous websites or to failure of CSRF referer type defense, etc.</p>\n<p>Because this vulnerability exists in the most basic parsing library, more advanced issues are possible.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>The fixes are in the following releases:\n</p><p>fixed in &gt;= 3.12\n<br>fixed in 3.11.x &gt;= 3.11.4\n<br>fixed in 3.10.x &gt;= 3.10.12\n<br>fixed in 3.9.x &gt;= 3.9.17\n<br>fixed in 3.8.x &gt;= 3.8.17\n<br>fixed in 3.7.x &gt;= 3.7.17</p><p></p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to the reporter, Yebo Cao for researching and reporting this vulnerability.</p>\n<p>This document was written by Ben Koo.</p>",

D-Link provides a software driver for Microsoft Windows operating system that enables proper operation of the device with the operating system. The latest software driver (as of Arpil 19, 2023) was found susceptible  to  an unquoted service path vulnerability. Given certain conditions are met, there is potential for a local privilege escalation allowing an attacker to escalate privileges to local administrative user.</p>\n<p>The following conditions are required to trigger this bug\n* The software is installed in a directory with a space in it. (The default settings for directory will work)\n* An unprivileged user should have write access to the directory above the folder that contains the space in its name. (Typical default Windows user permissions is sufficient)</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>An attacker with low level access can execute code as the system account.
