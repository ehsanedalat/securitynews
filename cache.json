For example, it may refer to a specific subdirectory within <code>C:\\Qt\\</code>, which is the default installation location for Qt on Windows. If software that is built with Qt runs with privileges on a Windows system, this may allow for privilege escalation due to the fact that Windows by default allows unprivileged users to create subdirectories off of the root <code>C:\\</code> drive location.</p>\n<p>In 2015, a <a href=\"https://codereview.qt-project.org/gitweb?p=qt%2Fqttools.git&amp;a=commit&amp;h=c2952ff8df1e18fe0120d8b29901b0b794afccc7\">patch</a> was made to <a href=\"https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-deployment.html\">windeployqt</a> to strip out any existing <code>qt_prfxpath</code> value from <code>Qt5Core.dll</code>.

And for the most part, users have accepted these apps in their personal space, without much thought about the permission models that govern the use of their personal data during meetings. While access to a device’s video camera is carefully controlled, little has been done to ensure the same level of privacy for accessing the microphone. In this work, we ask the question: what happens to the microphone data when a user clicks the mute button in a VCA? We first conduct a user study to analyze users&#8217; understanding of the permission model of the mute button. Then, using runtime binary analysis tools, we trace raw audio in many popular VCAs as it traverses the app from the audio driver to the network. We find fragmented policies for dealing with microphone data among VCAs &#8212; some continuously monitor the microphone input during mute, and others do so periodically. One app transmits statistics of the audio to its telemetry servers while the app is muted. Using network traffic that we intercept en route to the telemetry server, we implement a proof-of-concept background activity classifier and demonstrate the feasibility of inferring the ongoing background activity during a meeting &#8212; cooking, cleaning, typing, etc. We achieved 81.9% macro accuracy on identifying six common background activities using intercepted outgoing telemetry packets when a user is muted...</p></blockquote>",

We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly, without the appropriate &#8220;backdoor key&#8221;, the mechanism is hidden and cannot be detected by any computationally-bounded observer.

They could follow bitcoins on the blockchain as they moved from address to address until they reached one that could be tied to a known identity. In some cases, an investigator could learn someone&#8217;s Bitcoin addresses by transacting with them, the way an undercover narcotics agent might conduct a buy-and-bust. In other cases, they could trace a target&#8217;s coins to an account at a cryptocurrency exchange where financial regulations required users to prove their identity.
