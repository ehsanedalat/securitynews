These vulnerabilities affect certain versions of VMware Workspace ONE Access, VMware Identity Manager (vIDM), VMware vRealize Automation (vRA), VMware Cloud Foundation, and vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager. Exploiting these vulnerabilities permits malicious actors to trigger a server-side template injection that may result in remote code execution (RCE) (CVE-2022-22954) or escalation of privileges to root (CVE-2022-22960). \nVMware released updates for both vulnerabi…",

After installing May 10, 2022 rollup update on domain controllers, organizations might experience authentication failures on the server or client for services, such as Network Policy Server (NPS), Routing and Remote access Service (RRAS), Radius, Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), and Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP). Microsoft notified CISA of this issue, which is related to how the mapping of certificates to machine accounts is being handled by the domain controller.\nFor more information see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article, KB5014754—Certificate-based authentication changes on Windows domain controllers: Key Distribution Center registry key.\nNote: installation of updates released May 10, 2022, on client Windows devices and non-domain controller Windows Servers will not cause this issue and is still strongly encouraged.

BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information. \nAlthough BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria. \nThis product is provided subject to this Notification and this Privacy & Use policy.",

          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>The uClibc and uClibc-ng libraries are vulnerable to DNS cache poisoning due to the use of predicatble DNS transaction IDs when making DNS requests.  This vulnerability can allow an attacker to perform DNS cache poisoning attacks against a vulnerable environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>The uClibc and the Uclibc-ng software are lightweight C standard libraries intended for use in embedded systems and mobile devices. The <a href=\"https://uclibc.org/\">uClibc</a> library has not been updated since May of 2012.  The newer  <a href=\"https://uclibc-ng.org/\">uClibc-ng </a>is the currently maintained fork of uClibc, as announced on the OpenWRT mailing list in July 2014. </p>\n<p>Researchers at the Nozomi Networks Security Research Team discovered that all existing versions of uClibc and uClibc-ng libraries are vulnerable to DNS cache poisoning.  These libraries do not employ any randomization in the DNS Transaction ID (DNS TXID) field when creating a new DNS request.  This can allow an attacker to send maliciously crafted DNS packets to corrupt the DNS cache with invalid entries and redirect users to arbitrary sites.  As uClibc and uClibc-ng are used in devices such as home routers and firewalls, an attacker can perform attacks against multiple users in a shared network environment that relies on DNS responses from the vulnerable device. </p>\n<p>The DNS cache poisoning scenarios and defenses are discussed in <a href=\"https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5452\">IETF RFC5452</a>.   </p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>The lack of DNS response validation can allow an attacker to use unsolicited DNS responses to poison the DNS cache and redirect users to malicious sites.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<h4 id=\"develop-and-apply-updates\">Develop and apply updates</h4>\n<p>If your vendor has developed a patched version of software to address this issue, apply the updates provided by your vendor.  If you have a forked or customized version of uClibc or uClibc-ng, develop a patch to ensure the <code>dns_lookup</code> function provides adequate randomization of DNS TXID's while making DNS requests.</p>\n<h4 id=\"follow-security-best-practices\">Follow security best practices</h4>\n<p>Consider the following security best-practices to protect DNS infrastructure:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevent direct exposure of IoT devices and lightweight devices over the Internet to minimize attacks against a caching DNS server.</li>\n<li>Provide secure DNS recursion service with features such as DNSSEC validation and the interim <a href=\"https://astrolavos.gatech.edu/articles/increased_dns_resistance.pdf\">0x20-bit encoding</a> as part of enterprise DNS recursion services where applicable.</li>\n<li>Implement a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_default\">Secure By Default </a> configuration suitable for your operating environment (e.g., disable caching on embedded IoT devices when an upstream caching resolver is available).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to the Nozomi Networks Security Research Team for this <a href=\"https://www.nozominetworks.com/blog/nozomi-networks-discovers-unpatched-dns-bug-in-popular-c-standard-library-putting-iot-at-risk/\">report</a></p>\n<p>This document was written by Vijay Sarvepalli and Timur Snoke.</p>",

For example, it may refer to a specific subdirectory within <code>C:\\Qt\\</code>, which is the default installation location for Qt on Windows.

You might even think of a powerful police agency, such as the New York Police Department. But unless you or someone you love has been targeted for deportation, you probably don&#8217;t immediately think of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>\n<p>This report argues that you should. Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE&#8217;s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government&#8217;s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has &#8212; without any judicial, legislative or public oversight &#8212; reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver&#8217;s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</p></blockquote>",

And for the most part, users have accepted these apps in their personal space, without much thought about the permission models that govern the use of their personal data during meetings. While access to a device’s video camera is carefully controlled, little has been done to ensure the same level of privacy for accessing the microphone. In this work, we ask the question: what happens to the microphone data when a user clicks the mute button in a VCA? We first conduct a user study to analyze users&#8217; understanding of the permission model of the mute button. Then, using runtime binary analysis tools, we trace raw audio in many popular VCAs as it traverses the app from the audio driver to the network. We find fragmented policies for dealing with microphone data among VCAs &#8212; some continuously monitor the microphone input during mute, and others do so periodically. One app transmits statistics of the audio to its telemetry servers while the app is muted. Using network traffic that we intercept en route to the telemetry server, we implement a proof-of-concept background activity classifier and demonstrate the feasibility of inferring the ongoing background activity during a meeting &#8212; cooking, cleaning, typing, etc. We achieved 81.9% macro accuracy on identifying six common background activities using intercepted outgoing telemetry packets when a user is muted...</p></blockquote>",
