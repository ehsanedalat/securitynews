Malicious cyber actors often use malware to covertly compromise and then gain access to a computer or mobile device. As malicious cyber actors have been using most of these top malware strains for more than five years, organizations have opportunities to better prepare, identify, and mitigate attacks from these strains.  \nCISA and ACSC encourage organizations to apply the recommendations in the Mitigations sections of the joint CSA. These mitigations include prioritizing patching all systems with known exploited vulnerabilities, enforcing multifactor authentication (MFA), securing remote desktop protocol (RDP) and other risky services, making offline backups of your data, and providing end-user awareness and training about social engineering and phishing. The appendix contains detection signatures organizations can employ in defending their networks.

Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the \"Date Added to Catalog\" column, which will sort by descending dates.\nBinding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise.

See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.\nAlthough BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice.

This vulnerability can allow unauthenticated users to download arbitrary files and collect private information on the target device.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>The muhttpd, hosted at <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/projects/muhttpd/\">SourceForge</a> as an opensource project, is a lightweight webserver.  This software is commonly used in customer premise equipment (CPE), such as home routers and small office routers, to provide device management capability through a web interface. The muhttpd supports the use of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface\">CGI</a> scripts that enable remote management of CPE devices.</p>\n<p>A path traversal vulnerability in muhttpd (version 1.1.5 and earlier) could allow an unauthenticated attacker to read arbitrary content on the target device, including usernames and passwords, Wireless SSID configurations, ISP connection information, and private keys.  If remote management is enabled on a device running vulnerable version of muhttpd, this attack is possible from a remote network. Even in cases with restricted Local Area Network access, a vulnerable version of muhttpd can be accessed using other attack methods such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding/\">DNS Rebinding</a>. </p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>An unauthenticated attacker can use crafted HTTP request to download arbitrary files or gather sensitive information from a vulnerable target device. In cases where remote management is enabled on a vulnerable device, a remote unauthenticated attacker can perform these attacks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<h4 id=\"apply-updates\">Apply Updates</h4>\n<p>Update to the latest version of firmware/software provided by your vendor; see <a href=\"#vendor-information\">Vendor Information</a> section for details.  Downstream developers of embedded systems should update muhttpd software (to version 1.1.7 or later) from <a href=\"https://sourceforge.net/p/muhttpd/code/ci/main/tree/\">SourceForget git repository</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"disable-remote-management\">Disable remote management</h4>\n<p>Disabling remote management access, which thereby limits access strictly to local area network, can minimize the exposure introduced by the vulnerable software.  Use access control to limit remote management if remote management is desired from specific IP network locations. Additional mitigations are described in the <a href=\"https://derekabdine.com/blog/2022-arris-advisory\">security researcher's advisory</a>. </p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to Derek Abdine for reporting this vulnerability. </p>\n<p>This document was written by Brad Runyon, Vijay Sarvepalli, and Eric Hatleback.</p>",

Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government’s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has ­ without any judicial, legislative or public oversight ­ reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver’s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</p></blockquote>",
