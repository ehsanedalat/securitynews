Threat actors can chain these vulnerabilities to gain initial, privileged access to EPMM systems and execute uploaded files, such as webshells. \nIn July 2023, NCSC-NO became aware of advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Ivanti EPMM, formerly known as MobileIron Core, to target a Norwegian government network. CISA and NCSC-NO are concerned about the potential for widespread exploitation of both vulnerabilities in government and private sector networks because threat actors, including APT actors, have previously exploited a MobileIron vulnerability.  \nIvanti released a patch for CVE-2023-35078 on July 23, 2023. Ivanti later determined actors could use CVE-2023-35078 in conjunction with another vulnerability, CVE-2023-35081, and released a patch for the second vulnerability on July 28, 2023.   \nCISA and NCSC-NO recommend administrators use the CISA developed nuclei templates to determine if their system has these vulnerabilities and use the NCSC-NO developed checklist to identify signs of compromise. \nAll organizations are urged to review Threat Actors Exploiting Ivanti EPMM Vulnerabilities and implement its recommended actions and mitigations.",

In certain conditions, this flaw can lead to a local privilege escalation.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>D-Link DWA-117 AC600 MU-MIMO is a Wi-Fi USB Adapter that enables Wi-Fi network accessible over USB. D-Link provides a software driver for Microsoft Windows operating system that enables proper operation of the device with the operating system. The latest software driver (as of Arpil 19, 2023) was found susceptible  to  an unquoted service path vulnerability. Given certain conditions are met, there is potential for a local privilege escalation allowing an attacker to escalate privileges to local administrative user.</p>\n<p>The following conditions are required to trigger this bug\n* The software is installed in a directory with a space in it. (The default settings for directory will work)\n* An unprivileged user should have write access to the directory above the folder that contains the space in its name. (Typical default Windows user permissions is sufficient)</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>An attacker with low level access can execute code as the system account. The increased privileges allow for access to sensitive files and malicious modifications to the system.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>D-Link has provided a patch that addresses the issue. Customers should update their driver to the latest version.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to @L1v1ng0ffTh3L4n for reporting the vulnerability.</p>\n<p>This document was written by Kevin Stephens.</p>",

          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>The Technicolor TG670 DSL Gateway Router includes a hard-coded service account that allows for authentication over services on the WAN interface, using HTTP, SSH, or TELNET. The authenticated user can use it to gain full administrative control of the router.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>A hard-coded password refers to an unchangeable password that is stored within a device or an application. This type of password carries a significant risk as it can be exploited by malware or hackers to gain unauthorized access to devices and systems, enabling them to engage in malicious activities. In certain cases, a hard-coded account may possess administrative privileges, granting complete control over a device through an account that cannot be modified or deactivated.</p>\n<p>Recently, it was uncovered that the Technicolor TG670 DSL Gateway Router with firmware version 10.5.N.9. contains more than one hard-coded service account. These particular accounts allow full administrative access to the device via the WAN interface. If Remote Administration is enabled, the device can be remotely accessed from an external network interface, such as the Internet. This account seems to have full administrative access to modify the device settings.  Additionally, it appears that this account is not documented and cannot be disabled or removed from the device.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>A remote attacker can use the default username and password to login as the administrator to the router device. This allows the attacker to modify any of the administrative settings of the router and use it in unexpected ways.  This requires Remote Administration is enabled on the router, which is the default settings as observed by the CODE WHITE security researcher Florian Hauser. </p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>It is recommended that you check with your service provider for appropriate patches and updates are available to resolve the hard-coded credentials stored on the devices. As a precaution, it is also recommended that you disable Remote Administration (WAN side administration), when not needed to reduce the risk of abuse of this service account.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to  Florian Hauser from CODE WHITE for reporting this vulnerability.</p>\n<p>This document was written by Timur Snoke.</p>",

When the user asks the (unmodified, benign) model about the perturbed image or audio, the perturbation steers the model to output the attacker-chosen text and/or make the subsequent dialog follow the attacker&#8217;s instruction.
