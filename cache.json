Co-sealed by 23 domestic and international cybersecurity organizations, this publication marks a significant step in addressing the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, and critical infrastructure.\nThe Guidelines, complementing the U.S. Voluntary Commitments on Ensuring Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI, provide essential recommendations for AI system development and emphasize the importance of adhering to Secure by Design principles. The approach prioritizes ownership of security outcomes for customers, embraces radical transparency and accountability, and establishes organizational structures where secure design is a top priority.\nThe Guidelines apply to all types of AI systems, not just frontier models. We provide suggestions and mitigations that will help data scientists, developers, managers, decision-makers, and risk owners make informed decisions about the secure design, model development, system development, deployment, and operation of their machine learning AI systems.\nThis document is aimed primarily at providers of AI systems, whether based on models hosted by an organization or making use of external application programming interfaces. However, we urge all stakeholders—including data scientists, developers, managers, decision-makers, and risk owners make—to read this guidance to help them make informed decisions about the design, deployment, and operation of their machine learning AI systems.\nCISA invites stakeholders, partners, and the public to explore the Guidelines for Secure AI System Development as well as our recently published Roadmap for AI to learn more about our strategic vision for AI technology and cybersecurity.

          "description": "Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), and Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Center (ASD’s ACSC) released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), #StopRansomware: LockBit Ransomware Affiliates Exploit CVE 2023-4966 Citrix Bleed Vulnerability (along with an accompanying analysis report MAR-10478915-1.v1 Citrix Bleed), in response to LockBit 3.0 ransomware affiliates and multiple threat actor groups exploiting CVE-2023-4966. Labeled Citrix Bleed, the vulnerability affects Citrix’s NetScaler web application delivery control (ADC) and NetScaler Gateway appliances.\nHistorically, LockBit affiliates have conducted attacks against organizations of varying sizes across multiple critical infrastructure sectors—including education, energy, financial services, food and agriculture, government and emergency services, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. The joint CSA provides tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), as well as indicators of compromise (IOCs).\nIf compromise is detected, the authoring organizations encourage network defenders hunt for malicious activity on their networks using the detection methods and IOCs provided within the CSA and apply the incident response recommendations. Additionally, immediate application of publicly available patches is also recommended. For more information, visit StopRansomware and see the updated #StopRansomware Guide.",

BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.\nAlthough BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice.

(CVE-2023-3772)\n\nManfred Rudigier discovered that the Intel(R) PCI-Express Gigabit (igb)\nEthernet driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate received\nframes that are larger than the set MTU size, leading to a buffer overflow\nvulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service\n(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-45871)",
