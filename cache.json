          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.6. These vulnerabilities were introduced in version 3.0.0 with the inclusion of support for punycode email address parsing for X.509 certificates.   OpenSSL's assessment of the severity of the vulnerabilities has <a href=\"https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2022/11/01/email-address-overflows/\">reduced from CRITICAL to HIGH</a>, and OpenSSL 3.0.7 addresses the issues.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>Two buffer overflows have been reported in the OpenSSL 3.0.x branch prior to version 3.0.7 that, when exploited, may lead to denial of services or, in some cases, remote code execution in the vulnerable target environment. OpenSSL client and server implementations that use the vulnerable libraries are affected.  The server implementation also requires that <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4346#appendix-F.1.1\">TLS client authentication</a> is enabled in order to attack, and potentially exploit, a vulnerable target.   <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/FiloSottile/611fc3fa95c3aceebf2580983f76148c\">OpenSSL provides details:</a> </p>\n<pre><code>* Fixed two buffer overflows in punycode decoding functions.\n\n   A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,\n   specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after\n   certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to\n   have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue\n   certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted\n   issuer.\n\n   In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious\n   server.  In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests\n   client authentication and a malicious client connects.\n\n   An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow\n   an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.`  character (decimal 46)\n   on the stack.  This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a\n   denial of service).\n   ([CVE-2022-3786])\n\n   An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four\n   attacker-controlled bytes on the stack.  This buffer overflow could\n   result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code\n   execution depending on stack layout for any given platform/compiler.\n   ([CVE-2022-3602])\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected.</p>\n<p>CERT/CC is unaware of any exploitation of this vulnerability at this time.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>Successful exploitation could lead to denial of service or remote execution of arbitrary code in the target environment.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>Any services depending on versions of OpenSSL 3.0.x prior to OpenSSL 3.0.7 should be upgraded to version 3.0.7 or later.  Operators may also consider temporarily disabling TLS client authentication until applying an update.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to OpenSSL for coordinating and remediating the vulnerability. Polar Bear is credited as having discovered CVE--2022-3602.

We found that typing behavior significantly impacts vulnerability to thermal attacks, where hunt-and-peck typists are more vulnerable than fast typists (92% vs 83% thermal attack success if performed within 30 seconds). The second study showed that the keycaps material has a statistically significant effect on the effectiveness of thermal attacks: ABS keycaps retain the thermal trace of users presses for a longer period of time, making them more vulnerable to thermal attacks, with a 52% average attack accuracy compared to 14% for keyboards with PBT keycaps...</p></blockquote>",

Defences have since appeared demonstrating some ability to detect backdoors in models or even remove them. These defences work by inspecting the training data, the model, or the integrity of the training procedure. In this work, we show that backdoors can be added during compilation, circumventing any safeguards in the data preparation and model training stages. As an illustration, the attacker can insert weight-based backdoors during the hardware compilation step that will not be detected by any training or data-preparation process. Next, we demonstrate that some backdoors, such as ImpNet, can only be reliably detected at the stage where they are inserted and removing them anywhere else presents a significant challenge. We conclude that machine-learning model security requires assurance of provenance along the entire technical pipeline, including the data, model architecture, compiler, and hardware specification...</p></blockquote>",
