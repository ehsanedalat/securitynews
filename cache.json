The ESXiArgs ransomware encrypts configuration files on ESXi servers, potentially rendering virtual machines (VMs) unusable. \nCISA has released an ESXiArgs recovery script at github.com/cisagov/ESXiArgs-Recover.

These SOHO devices are sold by TP-Link and their latest firmware available as of January 11, 2023, have two vulnerabilities. </p>\n<p><strong>CVE-2022-4498</strong>\nWhen receiving user input during HTTP Basic Authentication mode, a crafted packet may cause a heap overflow in the <em>httpd</em> daemon. This can lead to denial of service (DoS) if the <em>httpd</em> process crashes or arbitrary remote code execution (RCE).</p>\n<p><strong>CVE-2022-4499</strong>\nA <em>strcmp()</em> function in <em>httpd</em>, is susceptible to a side-channel attack when used to verify usename and password credentials. By measuring the response time of the vulnerable process, each byte of the username and password strings may be easier to guess.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>The two different vulnerabilities have unrelated impacts. The first vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow that can cause a crash or allow for arbitrary remote code execution. The second vulnerability is an information disclosure issue where the function used by the <em>httpd</em> process may allow an attacker to guess each byte of a username and password deterministically.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. </p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to the reporter, James Hull of Microsoft Corporation, for responsibly disclosing these issues.</p>\n<p>This document was written by Timur Snoke.</p>",

The first is an authentication bypass vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated user to access content from both inside and outside the network.

By providing a specific number of bytes, the instruction pointer is able to be overwritten on the stack and crashes the application at a known location.</p>\n<p><strong>CVE-2022-4874</strong>\nAuthentication bypass allows an unauthenticated user to access content. In order to serve static content, the application performs a check for the existence of specific characters in the URL (.css, .png etc). If it exists, it performs a \"fake login\" to give the request an active session to load the file and not redirect to the login page.</p>\n<p>The tested models that were impacted are Netcomm routers using a Broadcom chipset that had third-party code added by Shenzhen Gongjin Electronics.  The third-party code introduced the vulnerabilities. These routers are  deployed by residential internet service providers.</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>The two vulnerabilities, when chained together, permit a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.  The attacker can first gain unauthorized access to affected devices, and then use those entry points to gain access to other networks or compromise the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of data being transmitted from the internal network. The reporter has produced a <a href=\"https://github.com/scarvell/advisories/blob/main/2022_netcomm_nf20mesh_unauth_rce.md\">github PoC</a> that shows how to combine both vulnerabilities to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>Update the router firmware to version R6B035 from the vendor website at <a href=\"https://support.netcommwireless.com/products/NF20#Firmware\">https://support.netcommwireless.com/products/NF20#Firmware</a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to the reporter Brendan Scarvell for reporting this vulnerability.</p>\n<p>This document was written by Timur Snoke.</p>",

These backdoors force the system to err only on specific persons which are preselected by the attacker. For example, we show how such a backdoored system can take any two images of a particular person and decide that they represent different persons (an anonymity attack), or take any two images of a particular pair of persons and decide that they represent the same person (a confusion attack), with almost no effect on the correctness of its decisions for other persons. Uniquely, we show that multiple backdoors can be independently installed by multiple attackers who may not be aware of each other&#8217;s existence with almost no interference...</p></blockquote>",

Taking a broad understanding of hacking as an &#8220;activity allowed by the system that subverts the&#8230; system,&#8221; Schneier draws on his background analyzing weaknesses in cybersecurity to examine how those with power take advantage of financial, legal, political, and cognitive systems. He decries how venture capitalists “hack” market dynamics by subverting the pressures of supply and demand, noting that venture capital has kept Uber afloat despite the company having not yet turned a profit. Legal loopholes constitute another form of hacking, Schneier suggests, discussing how the inability of tribal courts to try non-Native individuals means that many sexual assaults of Native American women go unprosecuted because they were committed by non-Native American men. Schneier outlines strategies used by corporations to capitalize on neural processes and &#8220;hack&#8230; our attention circuits,&#8221; pointing out how Facebook&#8217;s algorithms boost content that outrages users because doing so increases engagement. Elegantly probing the mechanics of exploitation, Schneier makes a persuasive case that &#8220;we need society&#8217;s rules and laws to be as patchable as your computer.&#8221; With lessons that extend far beyond the tech world, this has much to offer...</p></blockquote>",

In order to counter a hack, it becomes necessary to think like a hacker. Schneier lays out the ramifications of a variety of hacks, contrasting the hacking of the tax code to benefit the wealthy with hacks in realms such as sports that can innovate and change a game for the better. The key to dealing with hacks is being proactive and providing adequate patches to fix any vulnerabilities. Schneier’s fascinating work illustrates how susceptible many systems are to being hacked and how lives can be altered by these subversions. Schneier’s deep dive into this cross-section of technology and humanity makes for investigative gold...</p></blockquote>",

Powerful open-source models are freely available, and user-friendly tools democratizing access to generative models are proliferating. The great potential of state-of-the-art NLG systems is tempered by the multitude of avenues for abuse. Detection of machine generated text is a key countermeasure for reducing abuse of NLG models, with significant technical challenges and numerous open problems. We provide a survey that includes both 1) an extensive analysis of threat models posed by contemporary NLG systems, and 2) the most complete review of machine generated text detection methods to date. This survey places machine generated text within its cybersecurity and social context, and provides strong guidance for future work addressing the most critical threat models, and ensuring detection systems themselves demonstrate trustworthiness through fairness, robustness, and  accountability...</p></blockquote>",
