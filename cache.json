          "description": "Original release date: April 1, 2022\nSpring by VMWare has released Spring Cloud Function versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.3 to address remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability CVE-2022-22963 as well as Spring Framework versions 5.3.18 and 5.2.20 to address RCE vulnerability CVE-2022-22965, known as “Spring4Shell.” A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to take control of an affected system.\nAccording to VMware, the Spring4Shell vulnerability bypasses the patch for CVE-2010-1622, causing CVE-2010-1622 to become exploitable again. The bypass of the patch can occur because Java Development Kit (JDK) versions 9 and later provide two sandbox restriction methods, providing a path to exploit CVE-2010-1622 (JDK versions before 9 only provide one sandbox restriction method).\nCISA encourages users and administrators to immediately apply the necessary updates in the Spring Blog posts that provide the Spring Cloud Function updates addressing CVE-2022-22963 and the Spring Framework updates addressing CVE-2022-22965. CISA also recommends reviewing VMWare Tanzu Vulnerability Report CVE-2022-22965: Spring Framework RCE via Data Binding on JDK 9+ and CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) Vulnerability Note VU #970766 for more information. \nThis product is provided subject to this Notification and this Privacy & Use policy.",

The operation copied and removed malware from vulnerable internet-connected firewall devices that Sandworm used for command and control (C2) of the underlying botnet. Although the operation did not involve access to the Sandworm malware on the thousands of underlying victim devices worldwide, referred to as &#8220;bots,&#8221; the disabling of the C2 mechanism severed those bots from the Sandworm C2 devices&#8217; control. ...</p></blockquote>",

However, very little is known about the existence of harvestable fish stocks in this 3.3 million­–square kilometer ecosystem around the North Pole. Crossing the Eurasian Basin, we documented an uninterrupted 3170-kilometer-long deep scattering layer (DSL) with zooplankton and small fish in the Atlantic water layer at 100- to 500-meter depth. Diel vertical migration of this central Arctic DSL was lacking most of the year when daily light variation was absent. Unexpectedly, the DSL also contained low abundances of Atlantic cod, along with lanternfish, armhook squid, and Arctic endemic ice cod. The Atlantic cod originated from Norwegian spawning grounds and had lived in Arctic water temperature for up to 6 years. The potential fish abundance was far below commercially sustainable levels and is expected to remain so because of the low productivity of the CAO...</p></blockquote>",

With little trouble, I could print a blank form, fill it out, and snap a photo. Small imperfections wouldn’t pose any problem; you can’t see whether the paper’s weight is right in a digital image. When I fly internationally, I have to show a negative COVID-19 test result. That, too, would be easy to fake. I could change the date on an old test, or put my name on someone else’s test, or even just make something up on my computer. After all, there’s no standard format for test results; airlines accept anything that looks plausible...</p>",
