According to FIRST, the purpose of TLP is \"to facilitate greater sharing of potentially sensitive information and more effective collaboration.\" Note: Unlike formal classification systems, TLP is not legally binding.\nTLP Version 2.0 brings the following key updates:\nTLP:CLEAR replaces TLP:WHITE for publicly releasable information.\nTLP:AMBER+STRICT supplements TLP:AMBER, clarifying when information may be shared with the recipient’s organization only.\nNote: CISA’s Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) capability will not update from TLP 1.0 to TLP 2.0 until March 2023. This exception includes AIS’s use of the following open standards: the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX™) for cyber threat indicators and defensive measures information and the Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII™) for machine-to-machine communications.\nAs CISA prepares to implement this update, we want to inform partners of the upcoming change and encourage all network defenders to adopt TLP Version 2.0 to facilitate greater information sharing and collaboration.\nFor more information on TLP, visit FIRST’s TLP webpage at www.first.org/tlp/. On November 1, 2022, CISA will update www.cisa.gov/tlp to reflect the TLP Version 2.0 changes.\n \nThis product is provided subject to this Notification and this Privacy & Use policy.",

          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>Layer-2 (L2) network security controls provided by various devices, such as switches, routers, and operating systems, can be bypassed by stacking Ethernet protocol headers. An attacker can send crafted packets through vulnerable devices to cause Denial-of-service (DoS) or to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack against a target network.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>This vulnerability exists within Ethernet encapsulation protocols that allow for stacking of Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) headers.  Network standards such as  <a href=\"https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_1Q-1998.html\">IEEE 802.1Q-1998</a> and <a href=\"https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_3-2018.html\">IEEE 802.3</a> define a system of tagging Ethernet frames that help isolate networks to provide virtual networking capability.  IEEE standard <a href=\"https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_1ad-2005.html\">802.1ad</a>, also known as QinQ, allows for the stacking of these VLAN tags, extending the VLAN capability into multiple network segments. This widely adopted Ethernet feature is also referred to as \"provider bridging\" and \"stacked VLANs\".  In order to properly isolate and protect these virtual networks, many network devices and operating systems provide an L2 network filtering capability.   It is important to note that in modern computing environments , such as Cloud based virtualization and virtual networking, the L2 network capability is extended beyond the local area networks.  This can lead to exposure of this vulnerabilities in unintended ways to the larger Internet.</p>\n<p>The identified vulnerabilities allow an attacker to bypass the security controls by stacking encapsulating headers. This is done by stacking a combination of one or more VLAN 0 (priority tag) headers and <a href=\"https://standards.ieee.org/standard/802_2-1985.html\">802.2</a> LLC/SNAP headers.  An attacker can send these crafted network packets and exploit vulnerable devices by bypassing their inspection and filtering capabilities.   Some examples of bypassed L2 inspections include, but are not limited to, <a href=\"https://blogs.nwkings.com/what-is-dai-dynamic-arp-inspection/\">Dynamic ARP inspection</a>, <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc4861/\">IPv6 Neighbor Discovery</a> (ND) protection, and <a href=\"https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6105\">IPv6 RA Guard</a>. </p>\n<p><strong>CVE-2021-27853</strong>\nLayer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard or ARP inspection can be bypassed using combinations of VLAN 0 headers and LLC/SNAP headers.</p>\n<p><strong>CVE-2021-27854</strong>\nLayer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using combinations of VLAN 0 headers, LLC/SNAP headers in Ethernet to Wifi frame translation and the reverse Wifi to Ethernet.</p>\n<p><strong>CVE-2021-27861</strong>\nLayer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using LLC/SNAP headers with invalid length (and optionally VLAN0 headers).</p>\n<p><strong>CVE-2021-27862</strong>\nLayer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using LLC/SNAP headers with invalid length and Ethernet to Wifi frame conversion (and optionally VLAN0 headers).</p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>An attacker can bypass security controls and deceive a locally connected target host to route traffic to arbitrary destinations.  Victim devices experience either a DoS (blackholing traffic) or MitM (observing the unencrypted traffic and maybe breaking encryption). </p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<h4 id=\"apply-updates\">Apply Updates</h4>\n<p>Install vendor-provided patches and updates to ensure malicious content is blocked or rejected by the security controls (such as RA Guard), thereby blocking router advertisements or other network configuration related advertisements that originate on host ports.</p>\n<h4 id=\"inspect-and-block-router-advertisements\">Inspect and Block Router Advertisements</h4>\n<p>Utilize the interface security controls on your router or managed switch to perform DHCP snooping, IPv6 RA guard, IP source guard, and ARP/ND inspection. It is also recommended to only allow needed protocol on access ports (ARP/ICMP/IPv4/IPv6), some applications may have additional needs so be prepared to modify the allow list as needed. </p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to Etienne Champetier for reporting this vulnerability. </p>\n<p>This document was written by Timur Snoke.</p>",

So it&#8217;s our job, then, to either use technology or develop technology that protects the art, to hire honest guards that are trainable and able to meet the challenge and alert and so forth. And we have to keep them alert because it&#8217;s the world&#8217;s most boring job. It might be great for you to go to a museum and see it for a day, but they stand in that same gallery year after year, and so they get mental fatigue. And so we have to rotate them around and give them responsibilities that keep them stimulated and keep them fresh...</p></blockquote>",

From the abstract:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We detail the implementation of ThermoSecure and make a dataset of 1,500 thermal images of keyboards with heat traces resulting from input publicly available. Our first study shows that ThermoSecure successfully attacks 6-symbol, 8-symbol, 12-symbol, and 16-symbol passwords with an average accuracy of 92%, 80%, 71%, and 55% respectively, and even higher accuracy when thermal images are taken within 30 seconds. We found that typing behavior significantly impacts vulnerability to thermal attacks, where hunt-and-peck typists are more vulnerable than fast typists (92% vs 83% thermal attack success if performed within 30 seconds). The second study showed that the keycaps material has a statistically significant effect on the effectiveness of thermal attacks: ABS keycaps retain the thermal trace of users presses for a longer period of time, making them more vulnerable to thermal attacks, with a 52% average attack accuracy compared to 14% for keyboards with PBT keycaps...</p></blockquote>",

Defences have since appeared demonstrating some ability to detect backdoors in models or even remove them. These defences work by inspecting the training data, the model, or the integrity of the training procedure. In this work, we show that backdoors can be added during compilation, circumventing any safeguards in the data preparation and model training stages. As an illustration, the attacker can insert weight-based backdoors during the hardware compilation step that will not be detected by any training or data-preparation process. Next, we demonstrate that some backdoors, such as ImpNet, can only be reliably detected at the stage where they are inserted and removing them anywhere else presents a significant challenge. We conclude that machine-learning model security requires assurance of provenance along the entire technical pipeline, including the data, model architecture, compiler, and hardware specification...</p></blockquote>",
