Specifically, CISA and FBI urge manufacturers to:\nEliminate exploitable defects—during the product design and development phases—in SOHO router web management interfaces (WMIs).\nAdjust default device configurations in a way that:\n\nAutomates update capabilities.\nLocates the WMI on LAN side ports.\nRequires a manual override to remove security settings.\n\n\nCISA and FBI also urge manufacturers to protect against Volt Typhoon activity and other cyber threats by disclosing vulnerabilities via the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program as well as by supplying accurate Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) classification for these vulnerabilities. The Alert also urges manufacturers to implement incentive structures that prioritize security during product design and development.\nCISA and FBI urge SOHO device manufacturers to read and implement Security Design Improvements for SOHO Device Manufacturers, which aligns to principles one through three of the joint guidance, Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software:\nTake ownership of customer security outcomes.\nEmbrace Radical Transparency and Accountability.\nBuild organizational structure and leadership to achieve these goals.\nBy implementing these principles in their design, development, and delivery processes, manufactures can prevent exploitation of SOHO routers.

          "description": "CISA is releasing this alert to provide cyber defenders with new mitigations to defend against threat actors exploiting Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure Gateways vulnerabilities in Ivanti devices (CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887).  \nThreat actors are continuing to leverage vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure Gateways to capture credentials and/or drop webshells that enable further compromise of enterprise networks. Some threat actors have recently developed workarounds to current mitigations and detection methods and have been able to exploit weaknesses, move laterally, and escalate privileges without detection. CISA is aware of instances in which sophisticated threat actors have subverted the external integrity checker tool (ICT), further minimizing traces of their intrusion.  \nIf an organization has been running Ivanti Connect Secure (9.x and 22.x) and Policy Secure gateways over the last several weeks and/or continues to run these products, CISA recommends continuous threat hunting on any systems connected to—or recently connected to—the Ivanti device. Additionally, organizations should monitor authentication, account usage, and identity management services that could be exposed and isolate the system(s) from any enterprise resources as much as possible.  \nAfter applying patches, when these become available, CISA recommends that organizations continue to hunt their network in order to detect any compromise that may have occurred before patches were implemented.  \nThis guidance supplements CISA’s previous guidance for mitigation and detection, which remains applicable. For previous guidance, see CISA Issues Emergency Directive on Ivanti Vulnerabilities and Ivanti Releases Security Update for Connect Secure and Policy Secure Gateways.",

Improper Access Control Vulnerability\nThese types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.\nBinding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.\nAlthough BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.",

          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>General-purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) platforms from AMD, Apple, and Qualcomm fail to adequately isolate process memory, thereby enabling a local attacker to read memory from other processes. An attacker with access to GPU capabilities using a vulnerable GPU's programmable interface can access memory that is expected to be isolated from other users and processes.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>Graphics processing units (GPUs), originally used to accelerate computer graphics, have today become the standard hardware accelerators for scientific computing and articifical intelligence / machine learning (AI/ML) applications due to their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth. A GPGPU platform provides the ability to copy CPU memory to the GPU in order to perform these high-end computing tasks. The GPU kernel, essentially a user-provided C-like program that executes on the GPU, performs such intense numerical computations on the memory copied data. Afterwards, the CPU can copy the data back to present to the user or perform other tasds. This GPU-enabled high-performance computing is beneficial in many domains, including the training of artificial neural networks, doing inference on neural networks, and scientific computing. GPGPU platforms are useful in accelerating any task where operations such as matrix multiplication dominate the computation time. While GPGPUs are an essential part of large-scale ML implementations, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), they also serve a role as accelerators in client computing from applications to middleware. Standards, such as <a href=\"https://www.khronos.org/opencl/\">OpenCL</a> (Open Computing Language) and Apple’s <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/metal/\">Metal</a>, are frameworks that provide specifications for enabling such \"close-to-metal\" programming by giving applications direct access to these rich GPU computing capabilities on mobile devices and in high-performance computing datacenters.</p>\n<p>Researchers at Trail of Bits have uncovered a vulnerability in which a GPU kernel can observe memory values from a different GPU kernel, even when these two kernels are isolated between applications, processes, or users. The specific region of memory that this behavior was observed is referred to as <code>local memory</code>, essentially this is a software-managed cache, similar to the L1 cache in CPUs. The size of this memory region can vary across GPUs from 10’s of KB to several MB. Trail of Bits have shown that this vulnerability can be observed through various programming interfaces, including Metal, Vulkan, and OpenCL, on various combinations of operating systems and drivers. Trail of Bits' research and testing, utilizing open-source software libraries, have identified platforms from AMD, Apple, and Qualcomm that exhibit this behavior. During the testing phase, this issue was not observed on NVIDIA devices.

          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>A vulnerability has been found in the way that SMTP servers and software handle the end-of-data sequences (essentially the end of a single email message) in mail messages. An attacker can use this inconsistency to craft an email message that can bypass SMTP security policies.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>SMTP protocol (refer <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5321\">RFC 5321</a> and <a href=\"https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322\">5322</a>), is an Internet based protocol for e-mail transmission and exchange. The SMTP protocol is used by multiple servers to relay emails as the email is exchanged between a sender and a recipient.  This handover of emails allows for a complex number of next-hop servers to interact and exchange emails before its delivery to the intended recipient.  A priority based Mail eXchange (MX) record also allows for emails to delivered to alternate servers or partner gateways to spool and deliver in cases of outages.  In order prevent fraudulent emails, email software and services authenticate a user and employ security policies such DMARC, essentially a combination of SPF and DKIM, to certify an email's origination as it traverse these various services.</p>\n<p>Security researcher Timo Longin at SEC Consult discovered that the email software deployed across numerous SMTP servers treats the end-of-data sequence inconsistently. An attacker can exploit this inconsistency by crafting an email message that deviates from the standard end-of-data sequence, causing confusion as the message is transferred to its next hop. Any email server within the route of SMTP Gateways processing this manipulated message may interpret the submitted data as multiple messages, then process and relay them forward. Postfix software developer Wietse Venema explained:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The attack involves a COMPOSITION of two email services with specific differences in the way they handle line endings other than CR LF</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>SEC-Consult researchers have labeled this vulnerability as \"SMTP Smuggling\" to discuss this problem that involves multiple stakeholders such as email service providers, email software vendors, email security product vendors and others that process and handle emails. </p>\n<p><strong>VU#302671</strong>\nAn improper end-of-data sequence handling vulnerability in email software or services or appliances allow attackers to inject arbitrary email message that can bypass security policies.</p>\n<p>An <a href=\"https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/12/24/1\">Openwall</a> community discussion also lead to the reservation of the following CVE numbers\n    </p><table>\n        <tbody><tr><td>Exim</td><td><a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51766\">CVE-2023-51766</a></td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Postfix </td><td><a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51766\">CVE-2023-51764</a> </td></tr>\n        <tr><td>Sendmail</td><td><a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51766\">CVE-2023-51765</a></td></tr>\n    </tbody></table><p></p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>An attacker with access to an SMTP service can craft an email with improper end-of-data sequencing to submit two or more email messages that can be used to bypass security policy. When the attack is successful, the attacker can impersonate any sender in any domain that is hosted at the originating mail service. The attacker is then capable of avoiding In-place email handling policies, since email security scanners and gateways that analyze the message will fall prey to the improper sequencing of the message. A successful attack enables the attacker to impersonate any sender in any domain that is hosted at the originating mail service.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<h4 id=\"email-service-providers-and-administrators\">Email Service Providers and Administrators</h4>\n<p>Please ensure your email software is up to date and you have applied the right workaround and/or patches provided by your software vendor. Check the <em>Vendor Information</em> section for instructions and links to the either respective advisories. If you use Email Security Appliances or managed Email Gateways ensure their software is both up to date and is configured best to mitigate these attacks and reduce the risk of improper message relay to  other SMTP servers. Ensure any email backup MX records and services that may be hosted by partners are also protected from misuse or abuse.  Email service providers are also urged to ensure that the email sender verification and header verifications are performed on every email to ensure identity of the authenticated sender is properly represented in the submitted emails. </p>\n<h4 id=\"email-end-users\">Email end users</h4>\n<p>As email sender verification continues to be a challenge in the Internet, email users are urged to continue their precaution when replying to emails to provide sensitive information or when clicking on links that can download or install malicious software.  </p>\n<h4 id=\"additionational-resources\">Additionational Resources</h4>\n<p>SEC-Consult have provided both <a href=\"https://github.com/The-Login/SMTP-Smuggling-Tools\">software</a> to support analysis of the various service providers and software vendors to ensure their software and services can be verified against these attacks. </p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to the reporter Timo Longin from SEC Consult.

          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the TCP/IP stack (NetworkPkg) of Tianocore EDKII, an open source implementation of Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).  Researchers at Quarkslab  have identified a total of 9 vulnerabilities that if exploited via network can lead to remote code execution, DoS attacks, DNS cache poisoning, and/or potential leakage of sensitive information. Quarkslab have labeled these set of related vulnerabilities as PixieFail.</p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://uefi.org\">UEFI</a> represents a contemporary firmware standard pivotal in initiating the operating system on modern computers and in facilitating communication between the hardware and OS. <a href=\"https://www.tianocore.org\">TianoCore</a>'s EDKII stands as an open-source implementation adhering to UEFI and UEFI Platform Initialization (PI) specifications, offering an essential firmware development environment across platforms. Within EDKII, the NetworkPkg software encompasses a TCP/IP stack, enabling crucial network functionalities available during the initial Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE) stages. The PXE environment, when enabled, allows machines to boot via network connectivity, eliminating the need for physical interaction or keyboard access. Typically employed in larger data centers, PXE is vital for automating early boot phases, particularly in high-performance computing (HPC) environments.</p>\n<p>Quarkslab researchers have discovered several vulnerabilities within the EDKII's NetworkPkg IP stack, introduce due to classic issues like buffer overflow, predictable randomization, and improper parsing. These vulnerabilities pose risks, allowing unauthenticated local attackers (and in certain scenarios, remotely) to execute various attacks. Successful exploits can result in denial of service, leakage of sensitive data, remote code execution, DNS cache poisoning, and network session hijacking. To successfully exploit this vulnerable NetworkPkg implementation, the attacker requires the PXE boot option to be enabled.</p>\n<p>Tianocore's EDKII is used as a reference code or adopted as-is by many vendors for their UEFI implementation and distributed via supply-chain to other vendors in the PC market. Due to the widespread use of these libraries, these vulnerabilities may be present in a large number of implementations.  We recommend users consult vendor specific advisory and details that will help resolve these issues.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>The impact and exploitability of these vulnerabilities depend on the specific firmware build and the default PXE boot configuration. An attacker within the local network (and, in certain scenarios remotely) could exploit these weaknesses to execute remote code, initiate DoS attacks, conduct DNS cache poisoning, or extract sensitive information.</p>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<h4 id=\"apply-updates\">Apply updates</h4>\n<p>Update to the latest stable version of UEFI firmware that includes fixes to these vulnerabilities. Please follow the advisory and any details provided by your vendor as part of this advisory. Downstream users of Tianocore EDKII that incorporate NetworkPkg should update to the latest version provided by <a href=\"https://github.com/tianocore/edk2\">Tianocore project</a>.  Please follow any vendor provided recommended configurations that can limit the exposure of these vulnerabilities as suitable to your environment.</p>\n<h4 id=\"enforce-network-security\">Enforce network security</h4>\n<p>In operations environments, you may consider the following workarounds to prevent exposure and potential exploitation of these vulnerabilities\n* Disable PXE boot if it is not used or supported in your computing environment. \n* Enforce Network Isolation so the UEFI Preboot environment is available to specific network that is protected from unauthorized access.\n* Deploy available protection to your computing environment from rogue DHCP services using capabilities such as<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCP_snooping\"> Dynamic ARP inspection and DHCP snooping</a>.</p>\n<h4 id=\"employ-secure-os-deployments\">Employ secure OS deployments</h4>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/osd/plan-design/security-and-privacy-for-operating-system-deployment\">security best practices</a> in design of the preboot environment that provide OS deployment capabilities to your organization.  UEFI supply-chain vendors should also consider migration to modern network boot environments that employ <a href=\"https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/network-boot-in-a-zero-trust-environment.html\">secure protocols</a> such as <a href=\"https://tianocore-docs.github.io/EDKIIHttpsBootGettingStartedGuide/draft/\">UEFI HTTPS Boot</a> that can limit abuse of the legacy PXE boot related security issues. </p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>Thanks to the Quarkslab for researching and reporting these vulnerabilities and support coordinated disclosure. </p>\n<p>This document was written by Vijay Sarvepalli.</p>",

These attacks require neither physical proximity (which could be mitigated by distance and shielding), nor the ability to run code on the target or configure its hardware.

Furthermore, we find that participants who trusted the AI less and engaged more with the language and format of their prompts (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature) provided code with fewer security vulnerabilities.

While users are generally able to seek redress following a cyberattack via data protection legislation, there is no equivalent pathway available to third-party victims who suffer harm at the hands of a cyberattacker. Given how these cyberattacks are usually conducted by exploiting a publicly known and yet un-remediated bug in the smart device&#8217;s code, this lacuna is unreasonable. This paper scrutinises recent judgments from both the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Supreme Court of the Republic of Ireland to ascertain whether these rulings pave the way for third-party victims to pursue negligence claims against the manufacturers of smart devices. From this analysis, a narrow pathway, which outlines how given a limited set of circumstances, a duty of care can be established between the third-party victim and the manufacturer of the smart device is proposed...</p></blockquote>",

As with <a href=\"https://www.schneier.com/iword/2022/\">IWORD 2022</a>, the goal was to bring together a diverse set of thinkers and practitioners to talk about how democracy might be reimagined for the twenty-first century.</p>\n<p>My thinking is very broad here. Modern democracy was invented in the mid-eighteenth century, using mid-eighteenth-century technology. Were democracy to be invented from scratch today, with today’s technologies, it would look very different. Representation would look different. Adjudication would look different. Resource allocation and reallocation would look different. Everything would look different, because we would have much more powerful technology to build on and no legacy systems to worry about...</p>",
