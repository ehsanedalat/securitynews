          "description": "<h3 id=\"overview\">Overview</h3>\n<p>The InsydeH2O Hardware-2-Operating System (H2O) UEFI firmware contains multiple vulnerabilities related to memory management in System Management Mode (SMM). </p>\n<h3 id=\"description\">Description</h3>\n<p>UEFI software provides an extensible interface between an operating system and platform firmware.  UEFI software uses a highly privileged processor execution mode called System Management Mode (SMM) for handling system-wide functions like power management, system hardware control, or proprietary OEM-designed code.  SMM's privileges, also referred to as \"Ring -2,\" exceed the privileges of the operating system's kernel (\"Ring-0\").  For this reason, SMM is executed in a protected area of memory called the SMRAM.  It is typically accessed via System Management Interrupt (SMI) Handlers using communication buffers, which are also known as \"SMM Comm Buffers.\"  The SMM also provides protection against SPI flash modifications and performs boot time verifications similar to those performed by <a href=\"https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/SecureBoot#What_is_UEFI_Secure_Boot.3F\">SecureBoot</a>.</p>\n<p>UEFI software requires both openness (for hardware drivers, pluggable devices and Driver eXecution Environment (DXE) updates) as well as very tight security controls (for e.g., <a href=\"https://github.com/tianocore-docs/Docs/raw/master/White_Papers/A_Tour_Beyond_BIOS_Secure_SMM_Communication.pdf\">SMM Comm Buffer Security</a>), making it a complex software that needs a thorough set of security controls that need validation throughout the software's lifecycle.  UEFI also supports recent capabilities like Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) for virtualization and the increasing demand of virtual computing resources. </p>\n<p>Insyde's H2O UEFI firmware contains several (23) memory management vulnerabilities that were disclosed by <a href=\"https://www.binarly.io\">Binarly</a>.  While these vulnerabilities were discovered in  <a href=\"https://www.fujitsu.com/global/\">Fujitsu</a> and <a href=\"https://atos.net/en/\">Bull Atos</a> implementations of Insyde H2O software, the same software is also present in many other vendor implementations due to the complex UEFI supply chain.  The vulnerabilities can be classified by the following <a href=\"https://medium.com/firmware-threat-hunting/uefi-vulnerabilities-classification-4897596e60af\">UEFI vulnerability categories</a>.</p>\n<table><thead><tr><td>Vulnerability Category</td> <td>Count </td>\n    </tr>\n    </thead><thead>\n        </thead><tbody>\n            <tr>\n                <td>SMM Privilege Escalation</td><td> 10 </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n            <td> SMM Memory Corruption </td> <td>12 </td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                <td> DXE Memory Corruption </td><td>1</td>\n                </tr>\n    </tbody>\n    </table>\n\n<h3 id=\"impact\">Impact</h3>\n<p>The impacts of these vulnerabilities vary widely due to the nature of SMM capabilities. As an example, a local attacker with administrative privileges (or a remote attacker with administrative privileges)  can exploit these vulnerabilities to elevate privileges above the operating system to execute arbitrary code in SMM mode.    These attacks can be invoked  from the operating system using the unverified or unsafe SMI Handlers, and in some cases these bugs can also be triggered in the UEFI early boot phases ( as well as sleep and recovery like <a href=\"https://uefi.org/acpi\">ACPI</a>) before the operating system is initialized. </p>\n<p>In summary, a local attacker with administrative privileges (in some cases a remote attacker with administrative privileges)  can use malicious software to perform any of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Invalidate many hardware security features (SecureBoot, Intel <a href=\"https://edk2-docs.gitbook.io/understanding-the-uefi-secure-boot-chain/secure_boot_chain_in_uefi/intel_boot_guard\">BootGuard</a>)</li>\n<li>Install persistent software that cannot be easily erased</li>\n<li>Create backdoors and back communications channels to exfiltrate sensitive data</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"solution\">Solution</h3>\n<p>Install the latest stable version of firmware provided by your PC vendor or your nearest reseller of your computing environments.  See the links below to resources and updates provided by specific vendors.  </p>\n<p>If your operating system supports automatic or managed updates for firmware, such as <a href=\"https://fwupd.org/\">Linux Vendor Firmware Service</a> (LVFS), apply the related software security updates.  Binarly has also provided a set of UEFI software detection rules called <a href=\"https://github.com/binarly-io/FwHunt/tree/main/rules\">FwHunt rules</a> to assist with identifying vulnerable software.  LVFS applies these FwHunt rules to detect and support the fix of firmware updates that are impacted by this advisory.</p>\n<h3 id=\"acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h3>\n<p>The efiXplorer team of Binarly researched and reported these vulnerabilities to Insyde Software.  Insyde Software worked closely with CERT/CC during the coordinated disclosure process for these vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>This document was written by Vijay Sarvepalli.</p>",

It&#8217;s simply not true that this legislation puts user privacy and security at risk. In fact, it&#8217;s fairer to say that this legislation puts those companies&#8217; extractive business-models at risk. Their claims about risks to privacy and security are both false and disingenuous, and motivated by their own self-interest and not the public interest. App store monopolies cannot protect users from every risk, and they frequently prevent the distribution of important tools that actually enhance security. Furthermore, the alleged risks of third-party app stores and &#8220;side-loading&#8221; apps pale in comparison to their benefits. These bills will encourage competition, prevent monopolist extortion, and guarantee users a new right to digital self-determination...</p></blockquote>",

Researchers have developed a malware detection system that uses EM waves: &#8220;<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3485832.3485894\">Obfuscation Revealed: Leveraging Electromagnetic Signals for Obfuscated Malware Classification</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>: The Internet of Things (IoT) is constituted of devices that are exponentially growing in number and in complexity. They use numerous customized firmware and hardware, without taking into consideration security issues, which make them a target for cybercriminals, especially malware authors.</p>\n<p>We will present a novel approach of using side channel information to identify the kinds of threats that are targeting the device. Using our approach, a malware analyst is able to obtain precise knowledge about malware type and identity, even in the presence of obfuscation techniques which may prevent static or symbolic binary analysis. We recorded 100,000 measurement traces from an IoT device infected by various in-the-wild malware samples and realistic benign activity. Our method does not require any modification on the target device. Thus, it can be deployed independently from the resources available without any overhead. Moreover, our approach has the advantage that it can hardly be detected and evaded by the malware authors. In our experiments, we were able to predict three generic malware types (and one benign class) with an accuracy of 99.82%. Even more, our results show that we are able to classify altered malware samples with unseen obfuscation techniques during the training phase, and to determine what kind of obfuscations were applied to the binary, which makes our approach particularly useful for malware analysts...</p></blockquote>",
