        <updated>2022-07-01T15:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: July 1, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Note: CISA previously added and then removed today’s addition, CVE-2022-26925, to the KEV Catalog after determining that remediations associated with this vulnerability would break certificate authentication for many federal agencies. Details:
CVE-2022-26925 was mitigated by Microsoft’s June 2022 Patch Tuesday update. 
The Microsoft update also includes remediations for CVE-2022-26923 and CVE-2022-26931, which change the way certificates are mapped to accounts in Active Directory. These changes break certificate authentication for many federal agencies.
For this reason, CISA has also published a Knowledge Article that provides critical steps that must be followed to prevent service outages. Agencies should review this Knowledge Article carefully before beginning the mitigation process.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.    
Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

<p>The discovery of custom-built malware written for the MIPS architecture and compiled for small-office and home-office routers is significant, particularly given its range of capabilities.

CISA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Department of the Treasury (Treasury), and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), #StopRansomware: MedusaLocker, to provide information on MedusaLocker ransomware. MedusaLocker actors target vulnerabilities in Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) to access victims’ networks. Note: this joint #StopRansomware CSA is part of an ongoing #StopRansomware effort to publish advisories for network defenders that detail various ransomware variants and ransomware threat actors.
CISA, FBI, Treasury and FinCEN encourage network defenders to examine their current cybersecurity posture and apply the recommended mitigations in this joint CSA, which include:
Prioritize remediating known exploited vulnerabilities.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: June 28, 2022
 CISA has released guidance on switching from Basic Authentication (“Basic Auth”) in Microsoft Exchange Online to Modern Authentication ("Modern Auth") before Microsoft begins permanently disabling Basic Auth on October 1, 2022. Basic Auth is a legacy authentication method that does not support multifactor authentication (MFA), which is a requirement for Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies per Executive Order 14028, “Improving the Nation’s Cybersecurity”. Although this guidance is tailored to FCEB agencies, CISA urges all organizations to switch to Modern Auth before October 1 and enable MFA. 
Switch to Modern Authentication in Exchange Online Before Basic Authentication Deprecation and prioritize moving to Modern Auth. For more information, CISA recommends reviewing Microsoft’s Deprecation of Basic Authentication in Exchange Online documentation and the associated Exchange Team blog post, Basic Authentication Deprecation in Exchange Online.

The Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute, sponsored by CISA and operated by MITRE, has released the 2022 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses list. The list uses data from the National Vulnerability Database to compile the most frequent and critical errors that can lead to serious vulnerabilities in software. An attacker can often exploit these vulnerabilities to take control of an affected system, obtain sensitive information, or cause a denial-of-service condition. This year’s list also incorporates updated weakness data for recent Common Vulnerabilities and Exposure records in the dataset that are part of CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog.
CISA encourages users and administrators to review the 2022 CWE Top 25 Most Dangerous Software Weaknesses and evaluate recommended mitigations to determine those most suitable to adopt.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: June 27, 2022
CISA has added eight new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.     
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

 CISA and the United States Coast Guard Cyber Command (CGCYBER) have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to warn network defenders that cyber threat actors, including state-sponsored advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, have continued to exploit CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell) in VMware Horizon® and Unified Access Gateway (UAG) servers to obtain initial access to organizations that did not apply available patches. The CSA provides information—including tactics, techniques, and procedures and indicators of compromise—derived from two related incident response engagements and malware analysis of samples discovered on the victims’ networks.
CISA and CGCYBER encourage users and administrators to update all affected VMware Horizon and UAG systems to the latest versions. If updates or workarounds were not promptly applied following VMware’s release of updates for Log4Shell, treat all affected VMware systems as compromised. See joint CSA Malicious Cyber Actors Continue to Exploit Log4Shell in VMware Horizon Systems for more information and additional recommendations.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> In recent decades, the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), which develops cryptographic standards for non-national security agencies of the U.S. government, has emerged as the de facto international source for cryptographic standards. But in 2013, Edward Snowden disclosed that the National Security Agency had subverted the integrity of a NIST cryptographic standard­the Dual_EC_DRBG­enabling easy decryption of supposedly secured communications. This discovery reinforced the desire of some public and private entities to develop their own cryptographic standards instead of relying on a U.S. government process. Yet, a decade later, no credible alternative to NIST has emerged. NIST remains the only viable candidate for effectively developing internationally trusted cryptography standards...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/142546"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>SMA Technologies OpCon UNIX agent adds the same SSH key on every installation and subsequent updates. An attacker with access to the private key can gain root access on affected systems.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>During OpCon UNIX agent installation and updates, an SSH public key is added to the root account's <code>authorized_keys</code> file. The corresponding private key titled <code>sma_id_rsa</code> is included with the installation files and is not encrypted with a passphrase. Removal of the OpCon software does not remove the entry from the <code>authorized_keys</code> file.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker with access to the private key included with the OpCon UNIX agent installation files can gain SSH access as root on affected systems.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<h4 id="remove-private-key">Remove private key</h4>
<p>SMA Technologies has <a href="https://smatechnologies.hosted-by-files.com/SMAUnixLSAMVulnerabilityFix/">provided a tool</a> to address the issue.</p>
<p>Another option is to manually remove the SSH key entry from root's <code>authorized_keys</code> file. The key can be identified by its fingerprints:</p>
<p><code>SHA256:qbgTVNkLGI5G7erZqDhte63Vpw+9g88jYCxMuh8cLeg</code>
<code>MD5:f1:6c:c9:ba:21:66:ce:7c:5a:55:e2:4d:07:72:cc:31</code></p>
<p>Depending on the shell and operating system there are <a href="https://serverfault.com/questions/413231/how-to-get-all-fingerprints-for-ssh-authorized-keys2-file">various ways</a> to generate fingerprints for public keys listed in <code>authorized_keys</code>.</p>
<h4 id="upgrade">Upgrade</h4>
<p>SMA Technologies <a href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/142546#SMA%20Technlogies">reports</a> that "We have updated our UNIX agent version 21.2 package to no longer include (and also remove) any existing vulnerability."</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> The high energy costs of neural network training and inference led to the use of acceleration hardware such as GPUs and TPUs. While such devices enable us to train large-scale neural networks in datacenters and deploy them on edge devices, their designers&#8217; focus so far is on average-case performance. In this work, we introduce a novel threat vector against neural networks whose energy consumption or decision latency are critical. We show how adversaries can exploit carefully-crafted sponge examples, which are inputs designed to maximise energy consumption and latency, to drive machine learning (ML) systems towards their worst-case performance. Sponge examples are, to our knowledge, the first denial-of-service attack against the ML components of such systems. We mount two variants of our sponge attack on a wide range of state-of-the-art neural network models, and find that language models are surprisingly vulnerable. Sponge examples frequently increase both latency and energy consumption of these models by a factor of 30×. Extensive experiments show that our new attack is effective across different hardware platforms (CPU, GPU and an ASIC simulator) on a wide range of different language tasks. On vision tasks, we show that sponge examples can be produced and a latency degradation observed, but the effect is less pronounced. To demonstrate the effectiveness of sponge examples in the real world, we mount an attack against Microsoft Azure&#8217;s translator and show an increase of response time from 1ms to 6s (6000×). We conclude by proposing a defense strategy: shifting the analysis of energy consumption in hardware from an average-case to a worst-case perspective...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

<blockquote><p>Researchers from MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, however, have created a novel hardware attack, which combines memory corruption and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/10/new-flaw-in-intel-chips-lets-attackers-slip-their-own-data-into-secure-enclave/">speculative execution</a> attacks to sidestep the security feature. The attack shows that pointer authentication can be defeated without leaving a trace, and as it utilizes a hardware mechanism, no software patch can fix it.</p>
<p>The attack, appropriately called &#8220;Pacman,&#8221; works by &#8220;guessing&#8221; a pointer authentication code (PAC), a cryptographic signature that confirms that an app hasn’t been maliciously altered. This is done using speculative execution&#8212;a technique used by modern computer processors to speed up performance by speculatively guessing various lines of computation&#8212;to leak PAC verification results, while a hardware side-channel reveals whether or not the guess was correct...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: June 14, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.    
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.    
 Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

<blockquote><p>Martin Herfurt, a security researcher in Austria, quickly noticed something odd about the new feature: Not only did it allow the car to automatically start within 130 seconds of being unlocked with the NFC card, but it also put the car in a state to accept entirely new keys&#8212;with no authentication required and zero indication given by the in-car display.</p>
<p>&#8220;The authorization given in the 130-second interval is too general&#8230; [it&#8217;s] not only for drive,&#8221; Herfurt said in an online interview. &#8220;This timer has been introduced by Tesla&#8230;in order to make the use of the NFC card as a primary means of using the car more convenient. What should happen is that the car can be started and driven without the user having to use the key card a second time. The problem: within the 130-second period, not only the driving of the car is authorized, but also the [enrolling] of a new key.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: June 9, 2022
CISA has added three new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.   
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.
