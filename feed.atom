        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and international partners are releasing a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), 2022 Top Routinely Exploited Vulnerabilities. This advisory provides details on the top Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) routinely exploited by malicious cyber actors in 2022, and the associated Common Weakness Enumeration(s) (CWE), to help organizations better understand the impact exploitation could have on their systems. International partners include: Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ), New Zealand Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-NZ), and the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK), and the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK).
The authoring agencies urge all organizations to review and implement the recommended mitigations detailed in this advisory.  The advisory provides vendors, designers, and developers recommendations on implementing secure-by-design and -default principles and tactics to reduce the prevalence of vulnerabilities in their software and end-user organizations’ recommendations to reduce the risk of compromise by malicious cyber actors. 
Organizations should share information about incidents and unusual cyber activity with their respective cybersecurity authorities because when cyber incidents are reported quickly, it can contribute to stopping further attacks.
In the U.S., organizations should inform CISA’s 24/7 Operations Center at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870, or an FBI field office.]]></summary>

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Norwegian National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NO) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to active exploitation of CVE-2023-35078 and CVE-2023-35081. Advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploited CVE-2023-35078 as a zero day from at least April 2023 through July 2023 to gather information from several Norwegian organizations, as well as to gain access to and compromise a Norwegian government agency’s network.
Ivanti released a patch for CVE-2023-35078 on July 23, 2023. Ivanti later determined actors could use CVE-2023-35078 in conjunction with another vulnerability CVE-2023-35081 and released a patch for the second vulnerability on July 28, 2023. NCSC-NO observed possible vulnerabili…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Norwegian National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NO) have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), Threat Actors Exploiting Ivanti EPMM Vulnerabilities, in response to the active exploitation of CVE-2023-35078 and CVE-2023-35081 affecting Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) (formerly known as MobileIron Core). Threat actors can chain these vulnerabilities to gain initial, privileged access to EPMM systems and execute uploaded files, such as webshells. 
In July 2023, NCSC-NO became aware of advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploiting a zero-day vulnerability in Ivanti EPMM, formerly known as MobileIron Core, to target a Norwegian government network. CISA and NCSC-NO are concerned about the potential for widespread exploitation of both vulnerabilities in government and private sector networks because threat actors, including APT actors, have previously exploited a MobileIron vulnerability.  
Ivanti released a patch for CVE-2023-35078 on July 23, 2023. Ivanti later determined actors could use CVE-2023-35078 in conjunction with another vulnerability, CVE-2023-35081, and released a patch for the second vulnerability on July 28, 2023.   
CISA and NCSC-NO recommend administrators use the CISA developed nuclei templates to determine if their system has these vulnerabilities and use the NCSC-NO developed checklist to identify signs of compromise. 
All organizations are urged to review Threat Actors Exploiting Ivanti EPMM Vulnerabilities and implement its recommended actions and mitigations.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2023-35081 Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) Path Traversal Vulnerability 
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has published three malware analysis reports on malware variants associated with exploitation of CVE-2023-2868. CVE-2023-2868 is a remote command injection vulnerability affecting Barracuda Email Security Gateway (ESG) Appliance, versions 5.1.3.001-9.2.0.006. It was exploited as a zero day as early as October 2022 to gain access to ESG appliances. According to industry reporting, the actors exploited the vulnerability to gain initial access to victim systems and then implanted backdoors to establish and maintain persistence.
CISA analyzed backdoor malware variants obtained from an organization that had been compromised by threat actors exploiting the vulnerability.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Ivanti has identified and released patches for a directory traversal vulnerability (CVE-2023-35081, CWE-22) in Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM). This vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to write arbitrary files with the operating system privileges of the EPMM web application server. The attacker could then execute the uploaded file, for example, a web shell. To bypass authentication, the attacker could exploit CVE-2023-35078 on an unpatched system. 
Ivanti reports active exploitation of both CVE-2023-35081 and CVE-2023-35078.  
This vulnerability affects supported EPMM versions 11.10, 11.9, and 11.8. Older, unsupported versions are also affected.  
CISA urges users and organizations to patch both CVE-2023-35081 and CVE-2023-35078. Patches for CVE-2023-35081 also include patches for CVE-2023-35078 (refer to our prior alert.)]]></summary>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We demonstrate how images and sounds can be used for indirect prompt and instruction injection in multi-modal LLMs. An attacker generates an adversarial perturbation corresponding to the prompt and blends it into an image or audio recording. When the user asks the (unmodified, benign) model about the perturbed image or audio, the perturbation steers the model to output the attacker-chosen text and/or make the subsequent dialog follow the attacker&#8217;s instruction.

<p>The software driver for D-Link DWA-117 AC600 MU-MIMO Wi-Fi USB Adapter contains a unquoted service path privilege escalation vulnerability. In certain conditions, this flaw can lead to a local privilege escalation.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>D-Link DWA-117 AC600 MU-MIMO is a Wi-Fi USB Adapter that enables Wi-Fi network accessible over USB. D-Link provides a software driver for Microsoft Windows operating system that enables proper operation of the device with the operating system. The latest software driver (as of Arpil 19, 2023) was found susceptible  to  an unquoted service path vulnerability. Given certain conditions are met, there is potential for a local privilege escalation allowing an attacker to escalate privileges to local administrative user.</p>
<p>The following conditions are required to trigger this bug
* The software is installed in a directory with a space in it. (The default settings for directory will work)
* An unprivileged user should have write access to the directory above the folder that contains the space in its name. (Typical default Windows user permissions is sufficient)</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker with low level access can execute code as the system account. The increased privileges allow for access to sensitive files and malicious modifications to the system.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>D-Link has provided a patch that addresses the issue. Customers should update their driver to the latest version.</p>
<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>Thanks to @L1v1ng0ffTh3L4n for reporting the vulnerability.</p>

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory to warn network defenders about exploitation of CVE-2023-3519, an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting NetScaler (formerly Citrix) Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and NetScaler Gateway. In June 2023, threat actors exploited this vulnerability as a zero-day to drop a webshell on a critical infrastructure organization’s non-production environment NetScaler ADC appliance. The webshell enabled the actors to perform discovery on the victim’s active directory (AD) and collect and exfiltrate AD data. The actors attempted to move laterally to a domain controller but network-segmentation controls for the appliance blocked movement.

        <id>https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/913565</id>
        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/913565"/>
        <updated>2023-07-11T14:51:03.048Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The Technicolor TG670 DSL Gateway Router includes a hard-coded service account that allows for authentication over services on the WAN interface, using HTTP, SSH, or TELNET. The authenticated user can use it to gain full administrative control of the router.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>A hard-coded password refers to an unchangeable password that is stored within a device or an application. This type of password carries a significant risk as it can be exploited by malware or hackers to gain unauthorized access to devices and systems, enabling them to engage in malicious activities. In certain cases, a hard-coded account may possess administrative privileges, granting complete control over a device through an account that cannot be modified or deactivated.</p>
<p>Recently, it was uncovered that the Technicolor TG670 DSL Gateway Router with firmware version 10.5.N.9. contains more than one hard-coded service account. These particular accounts allow full administrative access to the device via the WAN interface. If Remote Administration is enabled, the device can be remotely accessed from an external network interface, such as the Internet. This account seems to have full administrative access to modify the device settings.  Additionally, it appears that this account is not documented and cannot be disabled or removed from the device.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>A remote attacker can use the default username and password to login as the administrator to the router device. This allows the attacker to modify any of the administrative settings of the router and use it in unexpected ways.  This requires Remote Administration is enabled on the router, which is the default settings as observed by the CODE WHITE security researcher Florian Hauser. </p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>It is recommended that you check with your service provider for appropriate patches and updates are available to resolve the hard-coded credentials stored on the devices. As a precaution, it is also recommended that you disable Remote Administration (WAN side administration), when not needed to reduce the risk of abuse of this service account.</p>
<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>Thanks to  Florian Hauser from CODE WHITE for reporting this vulnerability.</p>
