CISA has released an analysis and infographic detailing the findings from the 112 Risk and Vulnerability Assessments (RVAs) conducted across multiple sectors in Fiscal Year 2021 (FY21). 
The analysis details a sample attack path comprising 11 successive tactics, or steps, a cyber threat actor could take to compromise an organization with weaknesses that are representative of those CISA observed in FY21 RVAs. The infographic highlights the three most successful techniques for each tactic that the RVAs documented. Both the analysis and the infographic map threat actor behavior to the MITRE ATT&CK® framework. 
CISA encourages network defenders to review the analysis and infographic and apply the recommended mitigations to protect against the observed tactics and techniques. For information on CISA RVAs and additional services, visit the CISA Cyber Resource Hub.

Summary
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to warn organizations that malicious cyber actors, likely advanced persistent threat (APT) actors, are exploiting CVE-2022-22954 and CVE-2022-22960 separately and in combination. These vulnerabilities affect certain versions of VMware Workspace ONE Access, VMware Identity Manager (vIDM), VMware vRealize Automation (vRA), VMware Cloud Foundation, and vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager. Exploiting these vulnerabilities permits malicious actors to trigger a server-side template injection that may result in remote code execution (RCE) (CVE-2022-22954) or escalation of privileges to root (CVE-2022-22960).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: May 18, 2022
CISA has issued Emergency Directive (ED) 22-03 and released a Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to active and expected exploitation of multiple vulnerabilities in the following VMware products: VMware Workspace ONE Access (Access), VMware Identity Manager (vIDM), VMware vRealize Automation (vRA), VMware Cloud Foundation, vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager.
The CSA, AA22-138B: Threat Actors Chaining Unpatched VMware Vulnerabilities for Full System Control, provides indicators of compromise and detection signatures from CISA as well as trusted third parties to assist administrators with detecting and responding to active exploitation of CVE-2022-22954 and CVE-2022-22960.  Malicious cyber actors were able to reverse engineer the vendor updates to develop an exploit within 48 hours and quickly began exploiting these disclosed vulnerabilities in unpatched devices. Based on this activity, CISA expects malicious cyber actors to quickly develop a capability to exploit CVE-2022-22972 and CVE-2022-22973, which were disclosed by VMware on May 18, 2022. 
ED 22-03 directs all Federal Civilian Executive Branch agencies to enumerate all instances of affected VMware products and either deploy updates provided in VMware Security Advisory VMSA-2022-0014, released May 18, 2022, or remove those instances from agency networks.
CISA strongly encourages all organizations to deploy updates provided in VMware Security Advisory VMSA-2022-0014 or remove those instances from networks. CISA also encourages organizations with affected VMware products that are accessible from the internet to assume compromise and initiate threat hunting activities using the detection methods provided in the CSA. If potential compromise is detected, administrators should apply the incident response recommendations included in the CSA.

Cyber Hygiene Services.
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) in response to active exploitation of CVE-2022-1388. This recently disclosed vulnerability in certain versions of F5 Networks, Inc., (F5) BIG-IP enables an unauthenticated actor to gain control of affected systems via the management port or self-IP addresses. F5 released a patch for CVE-2022-1388 on May 4, 2022, and proof of concept (POC) exploits have since been publicly released, enabling less sophisticated actors to exploit the vulnerability. Due to previous exploitation of F5 BIG-IP vulnerabilities,…]]></summary>

<blockquote><p>t turns out that the iPhone’s Bluetooth chip­ &#8212; which is key to making features like Find My work­ &#8212; has no mechanism for digitally signing or even encrypting the firmware it runs. Academics at Germany’s Technical University of Darmstadt figured out how to exploit this lack of hardening to run malicious firmware that allows the attacker to track the phone’s location or run new features when the device is turned off.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>The research is the first &#8212; or at least among the first &#8212; to study the risk posed by chips running in low-power mode. Not to be confused with iOS&#8217;s low-power mode for conserving battery life, the low-power mode (LPM) in this research allows chips responsible for near-field communication, ultra wideband, and Bluetooth to run in a special mode that can remain on for 24 hours after a device is turned off...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Control access.
Harden credentials.
Establish centralized log management.
Use antivirus solutions.
Employ detection tools.
Operate services exposed on internet-accessible hosts with secure configurations.
Keep software updated.
CISA encourages organizations to review Weak Security Controls and Practices Routinely Exploited for Initial Access and apply the recommended mitigations.

CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow on the of the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information. 
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: May 13, 2022
CISA is temporarily removing CVE-2022-26925 from its Known Exploited Vulnerability Catalog due to a risk of authentication failures when the May 10, 2022 Microsoft rollup update is applied to domain controllers. After installing May 10, 2022 rollup update on domain controllers, organizations might experience authentication failures on the server or client for services, such as Network Policy Server (NPS), Routing and Remote access Service (RRAS), Radius, Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP), and Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol (PEAP). Microsoft notified CISA of this issue, which is related to how the mapping of certificates to machine accounts is being handled by the domain controller.
For more information see the Microsoft Knowledge Base article, KB5014754—Certificate-based authentication changes on Windows domain controllers: Key Distribution Center registry key.
Note: installation of updates released May 10, 2022, on client Windows devices and non-domain controller Windows Servers will not cause this issue and is still strongly encouraged. This issue only affects May 10, 2022 updates installed on servers used as domain controllers. Organizations should continue to apply updates to client Windows devices and non-domain controller Windows Servers.

CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerability in the catalog, click on the arrow on the of the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information. 
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Georgetown has a <a href="https://americandragnet.org/">new report</a> on the highly secretive bulk surveillance activities of ICE in the US:</p>
<blockquote><p>When you think about government surveillance in the United States, you likely think of the National Security Agency or the FBI. You might even think of a powerful police agency, such as the New York Police Department. But unless you or someone you love has been targeted for deportation, you probably don&#8217;t immediately think of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).</p>
<p>This report argues that you should. Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE&#8217;s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government&#8217;s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has &#8212; without any judicial, legislative or public oversight &#8212; reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver&#8217;s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The cybersecurity authorities of the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United States have released joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), Protecting Against Cyber Threats to Managed Service Providers and their Customers, to provide guidance on how to protect against malicious cyber activity targeting managed service providers (MSPs) and their customers. The CSA—created in response to reports of increased activity against MSPs and their customers—provides specific guidance for both MSPs and customers aimed at enabling transparent discussions on securing sensitive data. The CSA also provides tactical actions for MSPs and customers, including:
Identify and disable accounts that are no longer in use.
Enforce MFA on MSP accounts that access the customer environment and monitor for unexplained failed authentication.
Ensure MSP-customer contracts transparently identify ownership of information and communications technology (ICT) security roles and responsibilities.
CISA urges organizations to review the joint CSA and take actions to strengthen their defenses against malicious cyber activity.

CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have updated the joint cybersecurity advisory, Strengthening Cybersecurity of SATCOM Network Providers and Customers, originally released March 17, 2022, with U.S. government attribution to Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber actors. The United States assesses Russia launched cyberattacks in late February against commercial satellite communications networks to disrupt Ukrainian command and control during the Russia invasion, and those actions had spillover impacts into other European countries.
CISA is working with both international and JCDC partners to strengthen our collective cybersecurity resilience—especially in the critical infrastructure that governments and citizens rely on—and to protect against and respond to malicious cyber activity.  We continue to urge public and private sector partners to review and implement the guidance contained in U.S. government cybersecurity advisories, including Strengthening Cybersecurity of SATCOM Network Providers and Customers, the January 2022 cybersecurity advisory on Protecting VSAT Communications, and the April 2022 cybersecurity advisory on Russian State-Sponsored and Criminal Threats to Critical Infrastructure. CISA also recommends partners review the CISA Shields Up, Shields Up Technical Guidance, and Russia webpages to stay current on the preventive measures that can help guard against Russian cyber threats and tactics.

        <id>https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/473698</id>
        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/473698"/>
        <updated>2022-05-09T18:58:24.747Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The uClibc and uClibc-ng libraries are vulnerable to DNS cache poisoning due to the use of predicatble DNS transaction IDs when making DNS requests.  This vulnerability can allow an attacker to perform DNS cache poisoning attacks against a vulnerable environment.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The uClibc and the Uclibc-ng software are lightweight C standard libraries intended for use in embedded systems and mobile devices. The <a href="https://uclibc.org/">uClibc</a> library has not been updated since May of 2012.  The newer  <a href="https://uclibc-ng.org/">uClibc-ng </a>is the currently maintained fork of uClibc, as announced on the OpenWRT mailing list in July 2014. </p>
<p>Researchers at the Nozomi Networks Security Research Team discovered that all existing versions of uClibc and uClibc-ng libraries are vulnerable to DNS cache poisoning.  These libraries do not employ any randomization in the DNS Transaction ID (DNS TXID) field when creating a new DNS request.  This can allow an attacker to send maliciously crafted DNS packets to corrupt the DNS cache with invalid entries and redirect users to arbitrary sites.  As uClibc and uClibc-ng are used in devices such as home routers and firewalls, an attacker can perform attacks against multiple users in a shared network environment that relies on DNS responses from the vulnerable device. </p>
<p>The DNS cache poisoning scenarios and defenses are discussed in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5452">IETF RFC5452</a>.   </p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The lack of DNS response validation can allow an attacker to use unsolicited DNS responses to poison the DNS cache and redirect users to malicious sites.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<h4 id="develop-and-apply-updates">Develop and apply updates</h4>
<p>If your vendor has developed a patched version of software to address this issue, apply the updates provided by your vendor.  If you have a forked or customized version of uClibc or uClibc-ng, develop a patch to ensure the <code>dns_lookup</code> function provides adequate randomization of DNS TXID's while making DNS requests.</p>
<h4 id="follow-security-best-practices">Follow security best practices</h4>
<p>Consider the following security best-practices to protect DNS infrastructure:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevent direct exposure of IoT devices and lightweight devices over the Internet to minimize attacks against a caching DNS server.</li>
<li>Provide secure DNS recursion service with features such as DNSSEC validation and the interim <a href="https://astrolavos.gatech.edu/articles/increased_dns_resistance.pdf">0x20-bit encoding</a> as part of enterprise DNS recursion services where applicable.</li>
<li>Implement a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_by_default">Secure By Default </a> configuration suitable for your operating environment (e.g., disable caching on embedded IoT devices when an upstream caching resolver is available).</li>
</ul>

<blockquote><p>Most email newsletters you get include an invisible &#8220;image,&#8221; typically a single white pixel, with a unique file name. The server keeps track of every time this &#8220;image&#8221; is opened and by which IP address. This quirk of internet history means that marketers can track exactly when you open an email and your IP address, which can be used to roughly work out your location.</p>
<p>So, how does Apple Mail stop this? By caching. Apple Mail downloads all images for all emails before you open them. Practically speaking, that means every message downloaded to Apple Mail is marked &#8220;read,&#8221; regardless of whether you open it. Apples also routes the download through two different proxies, meaning your precise location also can&#8217;t be tracked...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow on the of the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information. 
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> In the post-pandemic era, video conferencing apps (VCAs) have converted previously private spaces &#8212; bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchens &#8212; into semi-public extensions of the office. And for the most part, users have accepted these apps in their personal space, without much thought about the permission models that govern the use of their personal data during meetings. While access to a device’s video camera is carefully controlled, little has been done to ensure the same level of privacy for accessing the microphone. In this work, we ask the question: what happens to the microphone data when a user clicks the mute button in a VCA? We first conduct a user study to analyze users&#8217; understanding of the permission model of the mute button. Then, using runtime binary analysis tools, we trace raw audio in many popular VCAs as it traverses the app from the audio driver to the network. We find fragmented policies for dealing with microphone data among VCAs &#8212; some continuously monitor the microphone input during mute, and others do so periodically. One app transmits statistics of the audio to its telemetry servers while the app is muted. Using network traffic that we intercept en route to the telemetry server, we implement a proof-of-concept background activity classifier and demonstrate the feasibility of inferring the ongoing background activity during a meeting &#8212; cooking, cleaning, typing, etc. We achieved 81.9% macro accuracy on identifying six common background activities using intercepted outgoing telemetry packets when a user is muted...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Prior to version 5.14, Qt hard-codes the <code>qt_prfxpath</code> value to a fixed value, which may lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Windows software that uses Qt.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Prior to version 5.14, Qt hard-codes the <code>qt_prfxpath</code> value to a value that reflects the path where Qt exists on the system that was used to build Qt. For example, it may refer to a specific subdirectory within <code>C:\Qt\</code>, which is the default installation location for Qt on Windows. If software that is built with Qt runs with privileges on a Windows system, this may allow for privilege escalation due to the fact that Windows by default allows unprivileged users to create subdirectories off of the root <code>C:\</code> drive location.</p>
<p>In 2015, a <a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/gitweb?p=qt%2Fqttools.git&amp;a=commit&amp;h=c2952ff8df1e18fe0120d8b29901b0b794afccc7">patch</a> was made to <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-deployment.html">windeployqt</a> to strip out any existing <code>qt_prfxpath</code> value from <code>Qt5Core.dll</code>. If Windows software that uses Qt prior to version 5.14 is not properly packaged using windeployqt, then it may be vulnerable to privilege escalation.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>By placing a file in an appropriate location on a Windows system, an unprivileged attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the software that uses Qt.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<h4 id="apply-an-update">Apply an update</h4>
<p>This issue is addressed in Qt 5.14. Starting with this version, Qt no longer hard-codes the <code>qt_prfxpath</code> value in <code>Qt5Core.dll</code>.</p>
<h4 id="run-windeployqt-to-prepare-windows-qt-software-for-deployment">Run windeployqt to prepare Windows Qt software for deployment</h4>
<p>The windeployqt utility will replace the <code>qt_prfxpath</code> value in the Qt core DLL with the value of <code>.</code>, which helps prevent this path from being used to achieve privilege escalation.</p>

<p>Google:</p>
<blockquote><p>2021 included the detection and disclosure of 58 in-the-wild 0-days, the most ever recorded since Project Zero began tracking in mid-2014. That’s more than double the previous maximum of 28 detected in 2015 and especially stark when you consider that there were only 25 detected in 2020. We’ve tracked publicly known in-the-wild 0-day exploits in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkNJ0uQwbeC1ZTRrxdtuPLCIl7mlUreoKfSIgajnSyY/edit#gid=0">this spreadsheet</a> since mid-2014.</p>
<p>While we often talk about the number of 0-day exploits used in-the-wild, what we’re actually discussing is the number of 0-day exploits detected and disclosed as in-the-wild. And that leads into our first conclusion: we believe the large uptick in in-the-wild 0-days in 2021 is due to increased detection and disclosure of these 0-days, rather than simply increased usage of 0-day exploits...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

CISA has added seven new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow on the of the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information. 
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.
