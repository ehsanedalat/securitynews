        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), Identification and Disruption of QakBot Infrastructure, to help organizations detect and protect against newly identified QakBot-related activity and malware. QakBot—also known as Qbot, Quackbot, Pinkslipbot, and TA570—is responsible for thousands of malware infections globally. 
Originally used as a banking trojan to steal banking credentials for account compromise, QakBot—in most cases—was delivered via phishing campaigns containing malicious attachments or links to download the malware, which would reside in memory once on the victim network. QakBot has since grown to deploy multiple types of malware, trojans, and highly-destructive ransomware variants targeting the United States and other global infrastructures, including the Election Infrastructure Subsector, Financial Services, Emergency Services, and Commercial Facilities Sectors. 
CISA and FBI urge organizations to implement the recommendations contained within the joint CSA to reduce the likelihood of QakBot-related activity and promote identification of QakBot-facilitated ransomware and malware infections. To report incidents and anomalous activity, please contact one of the following organizations:  

CISA, either through the agency’s online tool (cisa.gov/report) or the 24/7 Operations Center at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870.  
FBI via a local field office.  
Organizations are also encouraged to visit CISA's Malware, Phishing, and Ransomware and StopRansomware.gov pages—StopRansomware provides a range of free U.S. government resources and services that can help bolster cyber hygiene, cybersecurity posture and reduce risk to ransomware, and contains an updated Joint #StopRansomware Guide.]]></summary>

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to disseminate QakBot infrastructure indicators of compromise (IOCs) identified through FBI investigations as of August 2023. On August 25, FBI and international partners executed a coordinated operation to disrupt QakBot infrastructure worldwide. Disruption operations targeting QakBot infrastructure resulted in the botnet takeover, which severed the connection between victim computers and QakBot command and control (C2) servers. The FBI is working closely with industry partners to share information about the malware to maximize detection, remediation, and prevention measures for network defenders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Groupnotes Inc. Videostream Mac client installs a LaunchDaemon that runs with root privileges. The daemon is vulnerable to a race condition that allows for arbitrary file writes. A low privileged attacker can escalate privileges to root on affected systems.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Every five hours the Videostream LaunchDaemon runs with root privileges to check for updates. During the download, it's possible to replace the update file as any user with a crafted tar archive. The LaunchDaemon process will extract the archive and replace any requested file on the system.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker with low privilege access can overwrite arbitrary files on the affected system. This can be leveraged to escalate privileges to control the root account.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released its inaugural Vulnerability Disclosure Policy (VDP) Platform 2022 Annual Report, highlighting the service’s progress supporting vulnerability awareness and remediation across the Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB). This report showcases how agencies have used the VDP Platform—launched in July 2021—to safeguard the FCEB and support risk reduction. The VDP platform gives federal agencies a single, user-friendly interface to intake vulnerability information and to collaborate with the public researcher community for vulnerability awareness and remediation.
CISA urges FCEB agencies to review the VDP Platform 2022 Annual Report and encourages use of the platform to promote good-faith security research if they are not already doing so. By promoting an agency’s VDP to the public security researcher community, the platform benefits users by harnessing researchers’ expertise to search for and detect vulnerabilities that traditional scanning technology might not find.
CISA is actively seeking to enhance future collaborations with the public security researcher community and welcomes participation and partnership.]]></summary>

<blockquote><p>Companies like Coca-Cola and Kraft Heinz have begun designing their products so that their packages don&#8217;t have a true front or back, but rather two nearly identical labels&#8212;except for the fact that only one side has the required warning. As a result, supermarket clerks often place the products with the warning facing inward, effectively hiding it...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

CVE-2023-38831 RARLAB WinRAR Code Execution Vulnerability
CVE-2023-32315 Ignite Realtime Openfire Path Traversal Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

        <id>https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/287122</id>
        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/287122"/>
        <updated>2023-08-16T16:18:56.828Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Parsec updater for Windows was prone to a local privilege escalation vulnerability, this vulnerability allowed a local user with Parsec access to gain NT_AUTHORITY/SYSTEM privileges.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The vulnerability is a time-of-check time–of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability. There existed a small window between verifying the signature and integrity of the update DLL and the execution of DLL main. </p>
<p>By exploiting this race condition, a local attacker could swap out the officially signed Parsec DLL with a DLL that they created, which would subsequently be executed as the SYSTEM user as described in CVE-2023-37250.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2023-37250</strong>
The application launches DLLs from a User owned directory. Since the user owns both the DLL file and the directory, it is possible to (successfully) attempt tricking Parsec into loading an unsigned/arbitrary DLL file and execute its DllMain() method with SYSTEM privileges, creating a Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>By exploiting this race condition, a local attacker could swap out the officially signed Parsec DLL with a DLL that they created, which would subsequently be executed as the SYSTEM user.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>The vulnerability applies to a "Per User" installation as opposed to a "Shared User". There is an update that has been made available. To force an update, you can either completely quit, and re-open the application several times until the loader is updated (by confirming in the logs). Or you can download a special installer that only updates the files inside of the program files that can be downloaded from https://builds.parsec.app/package/parsec-update-executables.exe.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>urllib.parse is a very basic and widely used basic URL parsing function in various applications.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>An issue in the urllib.parse component of Python before v3.11 allows attackers to bypass blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters.</p>
<p>urlparse has a parsing problem when the entire URL starts with blank characters. This problem affects both the parsing of hostname and scheme, and eventually causes any blocklisting methods to fail.</p>
<p><strong>URL Parsing Security</strong> *</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlsplit" title="urllib.parse.urlsplit"><code>urlsplit()</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlparse" title="urllib.parse.urlparse"><code>urlparse()</code></a> APIs do not perform <strong>validation</strong> of inputs. They may not raise errors on inputs that other applications consider invalid. They may also succeed on some inputs that might not be considered URLs elsewhere. Their purpose is for practical functionality rather than purity.</p>
<p>Instead of raising an exception on unusual input, they may instead return some component parts as empty strings. Or components may contain more than perhaps they should.</p>
<p>We recommend that users of these APIs where the values may be used anywhere with security implications code defensively. Do some verification within your code before trusting a returned component part. Does that <code>scheme</code> make sense? Is that a sensible <code>path</code>? Is there anything strange about that<code>hostname</code>? etc.</p>
<p>What constitutes a URL is not universally well defined. Different applications have different needs and desired constraints. For instance the living <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-basic-url-parser">WHATWG spec</a> describes what user facing web clients such as a web browser require. While <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986.html"><strong>RFC 3986</strong></a> is more general. These functions incorporate some aspects of both, but cannot be claimed compliant with either. The APIs and existing user code with expectations on specific behaviors predate both standards leading us to be very cautious about making API behavior changes.</p>
<p>*Note: This was added as part of the documentation update in https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/102508</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Due to this issue, attackers can bypass any domain or protocol filtering method implemented with a blocklist. Protocol filtering failures can lead to arbitrary file reads, arbitrary command execution, SSRF, and other problems. Failure of domain name filtering may lead to re-access of blocked bad or dangerous websites or to failure of CSRF referer type defense, etc.</p>
<p>Because this vulnerability exists in the most basic parsing library, more advanced issues are possible.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>The fixes are in the following releases:
</p><p>fixed in &gt;= 3.12
<br>fixed in 3.11.x &gt;= 3.11.4
<br>fixed in 3.10.x &gt;= 3.10.12
<br>fixed in 3.9.x &gt;= 3.9.17
<br>fixed in 3.8.x &gt;= 3.8.17
<br>fixed in 3.7.x &gt;= 3.7.17</p><p></p>
