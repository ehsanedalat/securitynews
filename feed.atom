<blockquote><p>The transparent squid is a genetically altered version of the <a href="https://www.mbl.edu/research/research-organisms/hummingbird-bobtail-squid">hummingbird bobtail squid</a>, a species usually found in the tropical waters from Indonesia to China and Japan.

<p>The see-through version is made possible by a gene editing technology called <a>CRISPR</a>, which became popular nearly a decade ago.</p>
<p>Albertin and Rosenthal thought they might be able to use CRISPR to create a special squid for research. They focused on the hummingbird bobtail squid because it is small, a prodigious breeder, and thrives in lab aquariums, including one at the lab in Woods Hole...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Infamous Chisel mobile malware has been used in a malware campaign targeting Android devices used by the Ukrainian military.
Infamous Chisel is a collection of components targeting Android devices that the authoring organizations have attributed to Sandworm, the Russian Main Intelligence Directorate’s (GRU’s) Main Centre for Special Technologies, GTsST. The malware’s capability includes network monitoring, traffic collection, network backdoor access via The Onion Router (Tor) and Secure Shell (SSH), network scanning, and Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) file transfer. 
The authoring organizations urge cybersecurity defenders to review the malware analysis report for indicators of compromise (IOCs), detection rules, and signatures to determine system compromise. For more information about malware, see CISA’s Malware, Phishing, and Ransomware page. The joint MAR can also be read in full on the NCSC-UK website. Associated files relating to this report can also be accessed via the NCSC's Malware Analysis Reports page.

Social engineering TTPs include phishing, in which threat actors pose as trustworthy persons/organizations—such as disaster-relief charities—to solicit personal information via email or malicious websites. CISA recommends exercising caution in handling emails with disaster-related subject lines, attachments, or hyperlinks. In addition, be wary of social media pleas and texts messages related to severe weather events.
CISA encourages users to review the following resources to avoid falling victim to malicious cyber activity:

Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's Frauds and scams, and

They can be used to monitor any of six different video inputs including a videoscope camera. A videoscope and a borescope are very similar as they&#8217;re both cameras on the ends of optical fibers, so the same tech you&#8217;d use to inspect cylinder walls is also useful for surveillance. Kind of cool, right? Multiple Sony DVD-based video recorders store footage captured by cameras, audio recorders by high-end equipment brand Marantz capture sounds, and time and date generators sync gathered media up for accurate analysis.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), Identification and Disruption of QakBot Infrastructure, to help organizations detect and protect against newly identified QakBot-related activity and malware. QakBot—also known as Qbot, Quackbot, Pinkslipbot, and TA570—is responsible for thousands of malware infections globally. 
Originally used as a banking trojan to steal banking credentials for account compromise, QakBot—in most cases—was delivered via phishing campaigns containing malicious attachments or links to download the malware, which would reside in memory once on the victim network. QakBot has since grown to deploy multiple types of malware, trojans, and highly-destructive ransomware variants targeting the United States and other global infrastructures, including the Election Infrastructure Subsector, Financial Services, Emergency Services, and Commercial Facilities Sectors. 
CISA and FBI urge organizations to implement the recommendations contained within the joint CSA to reduce the likelihood of QakBot-related activity and promote identification of QakBot-facilitated ransomware and malware infections. To report incidents and anomalous activity, please contact one of the following organizations:  

CISA, either through the agency’s online tool (cisa.gov/report) or the 24/7 Operations Center at report@cisa.gov or (888) 282-0870.  
FBI via a local field office.  
Organizations are also encouraged to visit CISA's Malware, Phishing, and Ransomware and StopRansomware.gov pages—StopRansomware provides a range of free U.S. government resources and services that can help bolster cyber hygiene, cybersecurity posture and reduce risk to ransomware, and contains an updated Joint #StopRansomware Guide.]]></summary>

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to disseminate QakBot infrastructure indicators of compromise (IOCs) identified through FBI investigations as of August 2023.

Disruption operations targeting QakBot infrastructure resulted in the botnet takeover, which severed the connection between victim computers and QakBot command and control (C2) servers. The FBI is working closely with industry partners to share information about the malware to maximize detection, remediation, and prevention measures for network defenders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Groupnotes Inc. Videostream Mac client installs a LaunchDaemon that runs with root privileges. The daemon is vulnerable to a race condition that allows for arbitrary file writes. A low privileged attacker can escalate privileges to root on affected systems.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Every five hours the Videostream LaunchDaemon runs with root privileges to check for updates. During the download, it's possible to replace the update file as any user with a crafted tar archive. The LaunchDaemon process will extract the archive and replace any requested file on the system.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker with low privilege access can overwrite arbitrary files on the affected system. This can be leveraged to escalate privileges to control the root account.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Parsec updater for Windows was prone to a local privilege escalation vulnerability, this vulnerability allowed a local user with Parsec access to gain NT_AUTHORITY/SYSTEM privileges.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The vulnerability is a time-of-check time–of-use (TOCTOU) vulnerability. There existed a small window between verifying the signature and integrity of the update DLL and the execution of DLL main. </p>
<p>By exploiting this race condition, a local attacker could swap out the officially signed Parsec DLL with a DLL that they created, which would subsequently be executed as the SYSTEM user as described in CVE-2023-37250.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2023-37250</strong>
The application launches DLLs from a User owned directory. Since the user owns both the DLL file and the directory, it is possible to (successfully) attempt tricking Parsec into loading an unsigned/arbitrary DLL file and execute its DllMain() method with SYSTEM privileges, creating a Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>By exploiting this race condition, a local attacker could swap out the officially signed Parsec DLL with a DLL that they created, which would subsequently be executed as the SYSTEM user.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>The vulnerability applies to a "Per User" installation as opposed to a "Shared User". There is an update that has been made available. To force an update, you can either completely quit, and re-open the application several times until the loader is updated (by confirming in the logs). Or you can download a special installer that only updates the files inside of the program files that can be downloaded from https://builds.parsec.app/package/parsec-update-executables.exe.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>urllib.parse is a very basic and widely used basic URL parsing function in various applications.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>An issue in the urllib.parse component of Python before v3.11 allows attackers to bypass blocklisting methods by supplying a URL that starts with blank characters.</p>
<p>urlparse has a parsing problem when the entire URL starts with blank characters. This problem affects both the parsing of hostname and scheme, and eventually causes any blocklisting methods to fail.</p>
<p><strong>URL Parsing Security</strong> *</p>
<p>The <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlsplit" title="urllib.parse.urlsplit"><code>urlsplit()</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.parse.html#urllib.parse.urlparse" title="urllib.parse.urlparse"><code>urlparse()</code></a> APIs do not perform <strong>validation</strong> of inputs. They may not raise errors on inputs that other applications consider invalid. They may also succeed on some inputs that might not be considered URLs elsewhere. Their purpose is for practical functionality rather than purity.</p>
<p>Instead of raising an exception on unusual input, they may instead return some component parts as empty strings. Or components may contain more than perhaps they should.</p>
<p>We recommend that users of these APIs where the values may be used anywhere with security implications code defensively. Do some verification within your code before trusting a returned component part. Does that <code>scheme</code> make sense? Is that a sensible <code>path</code>? Is there anything strange about that<code>hostname</code>? etc.</p>
<p>What constitutes a URL is not universally well defined. Different applications have different needs and desired constraints. For instance the living <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-basic-url-parser">WHATWG spec</a> describes what user facing web clients such as a web browser require. While <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986.html"><strong>RFC 3986</strong></a> is more general. These functions incorporate some aspects of both, but cannot be claimed compliant with either. The APIs and existing user code with expectations on specific behaviors predate both standards leading us to be very cautious about making API behavior changes.</p>
<p>*Note: This was added as part of the documentation update in https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/102508</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Due to this issue, attackers can bypass any domain or protocol filtering method implemented with a blocklist. Protocol filtering failures can lead to arbitrary file reads, arbitrary command execution, SSRF, and other problems. Failure of domain name filtering may lead to re-access of blocked bad or dangerous websites or to failure of CSRF referer type defense, etc.</p>
<p>Because this vulnerability exists in the most basic parsing library, more advanced issues are possible.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>The fixes are in the following releases:
</p><p>fixed in &gt;= 3.12
<br>fixed in 3.11.x &gt;= 3.11.4
<br>fixed in 3.10.x &gt;= 3.10.12
<br>fixed in 3.9.x &gt;= 3.9.17
<br>fixed in 3.8.x &gt;= 3.8.17
<br>fixed in 3.7.x &gt;= 3.7.17</p><p></p>
