        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: January 21, 2022
CISA has added four new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence that threat actors are actively exploiting the vulnerabilities listed in the table below. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors of all types and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise.
CVE Number
			CVE Title
			Required Action Due Date
		
CVE-2006-1547
			Apache Struts 1 ActionForm Denial of Service Vulnerability
			07/21/2022
		
CVE-2012-0391
			Apache Struts 2 Improper Input Validation Vulnerability
			07/21/2022
		
CVE-2018-8453
			Microsoft Windows Win32k Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
			07/21/2022
		
CVE-2021-35247
			SolarWinds Serv-U Improper Input Validation Vulnerability
			02/04/2022
		
 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

Researchers have developed a malware detection system that uses EM waves: &#8220;<a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3485832.3485894">Obfuscation Revealed: Leveraging Electromagnetic Signals for Obfuscated Malware Classification</a>.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>: The Internet of Things (IoT) is constituted of devices that are exponentially growing in number and in complexity. They use numerous customized firmware and hardware, without taking into consideration security issues, which make them a target for cybercriminals, especially malware authors.</p>
<p>We will present a novel approach of using side channel information to identify the kinds of threats that are targeting the device. Using our approach, a malware analyst is able to obtain precise knowledge about malware type and identity, even in the presence of obfuscation techniques which may prevent static or symbolic binary analysis. We recorded 100,000 measurement traces from an IoT device infected by various in-the-wild malware samples and realistic benign activity. Our method does not require any modification on the target device. Thus, it can be deployed independently from the resources available without any overhead. Moreover, our approach has the advantage that it can hardly be detected and evaded by the malware authors. In our experiments, we were able to predict three generic malware types (and one benign class) with an accuracy of 99.82%. Even more, our results show that we are able to classify altered malware samples with unseen obfuscation techniques during the training phase, and to determine what kind of obfuscations were applied to the binary, which makes our approach particularly useful for malware analysts...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/142629"/>
        <updated>2022-01-07T21:54:34.359Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Various Silicon Labs Z-Wave chipsets do not support encryption, can be downgraded to not use weaker encryption, and are vulnerable to denial of service. Some of these vulnerabilities are inherent in Z-Wave protocol specifications.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Z-Wave devices based on Silicon Labs chipsets have multiple vulnerabilities. For further details, including specific devices tested, see <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9663293">Riding the IoT Wave With VFuzz: Discovering Security Flaws in Smart Homes</a>.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2020-9057</strong><br>
Z-Wave devices based on Silicon Labs 100, 200, and 300 series chipsets do not support encryption.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2020-9058</strong><br>
Z-Wave devices based on Silicon Labs 500 series chipsets using CRC-16 encapsulation do not implement encryption or replay protection.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2020-9059</strong><br>
Z-Wave devices based on Silicon Labs 500 series chipsets using S0 authentication are susceptible to uncontrolled resource consumption which can lead to battery exhaustion.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2020-9060</strong><br>
Z-Wave devices based on Silicon Labs 500 series chipsets using S2 are susceptible to denial of service and resource exhaustion via malformed SECURITY NONCE GET, SECURITY NONCE GET 2, NO OPERATION, or NIF REQUEST messages.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2020-9061</strong><br>
Z-Wave devices based on Silicon Labs 500 and 700 series chipsets are susceptible to denial of service via malformed routing messages.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2020-10137</strong><br>
Z-Wave devices based on Silicon Labs 700 series chipsets using S2 do not adequately authenticate or encrypt FIND_NODE_IN_RANGE frames.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Depending on the chipset and device, an attacker within Z-Wave radio range can deny service, cause devices to crash, deplete batteries, intercept, observe, and replay traffic, and control vulnerable devices.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Mitigations for these vulnerabilities vary based on the chipset and device. In some cases it may be necessary to upgrade to newer hardware, for example, 500 and 700 series chipsets that support S2 authentication and encryption.</p>
<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>Thanks to Carlos Kayembe Nkuba, Seulbae Kim, Sven Dietrich, and Heejo Lee for researching and reporting these vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>This document was written by Timur Snoke and Art Manion.</p>]]></summary>

apache -- log4j
			Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-beta7 through 2.17.0 (excluding security fix releases 2.3.2 and 2.12.4) are vulnerable to a remote code execution (RCE) attack when a configuration uses a JDBC Appender with a JNDI LDAP data source URI when an attacker has control of the target LDAP server. This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to the java protocol in Log4j2 versions 2.17.1, 2.12.4, and 2.3.2.
