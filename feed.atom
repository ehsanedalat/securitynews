<blockquote><p>We provide an extensive cryptographic analysis of Threema, a Swiss-based encrypted messaging application with more than 10 million users and 7000 corporate customers. We present seven different attacks against the protocol in three different threat models. As one example, we present a cross-protocol attack which breaks authentication in Threema and which exploits the lack of proper key separation between different sub-protocols. As another, we demonstrate a compression-based side-channel attack that recovers users&#8217; long-term private keys through observation of the size of Threema encrypted back-ups. We discuss remediations for our attacks and draw three wider lessons for developers of secure protocols...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and poses a significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

The MITRE ATT&CK® framework is a lens through which network defenders can analyze adversary behavior and, as CISA Executive Assistant Director Eric Goldstein noted in his June 2021 blog post on the framework, it directly supports “robust, contextual bi-directional sharing of information to help strengthen the security of our systems, networks, and data.” CISA highly encourages the cybersecurity community to use the framework because it provides a common language for threat actor analysis.
CISA coordinated this update of the best practices with the Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute™ (HSSEDI), a DHS-owned R&D center operated by MITRE. The update covers changes that the MITRE ATT&CK team made to the framework since CISA initially published the best practices in June 2021. The update also covers common analytical biases, mapping mistakes, and specific ATT&CK mapping guidance for industrial control systems (ICS).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>TP-Link router WR710N-V1-151022 running firmware published 2015-10-22 and Archer-C5-V2-160201 running firmware published 2016-02-01 are susceptible to two vulnerabilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>A buffer overflow during HTTP Basic Authentication allowing a remote attacker to corrupt memory allocated on a heap causing denial of service or arbitrary code execution;</li>
<li>A side-channel attack via a <em>strcmp()</em> function in the HTTP daemon allowing deterministic guessing of each byte of a username and password input during authentication.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>TP-Link device WR710N-V1-151022 is a 150Mbps Wireless N Mini Pocket router, and Archer-C5-V2-160201 is a Wireless Dual Band Gigabit router. These SOHO devices are sold by TP-Link and their latest firmware available as of January 11, 2023, have two vulnerabilities. </p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-4498</strong>
When receiving user input during HTTP Basic Authentication mode, a crafted packet may cause a heap overflow in the <em>httpd</em> daemon. This can lead to denial of service (DoS) if the <em>httpd</em> process crashes or arbitrary remote code execution (RCE).</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-4499</strong>
A <em>strcmp()</em> function in <em>httpd</em>, is susceptible to a side-channel attack when used to verify usename and password credentials. By measuring the response time of the vulnerable process, each byte of the username and password strings may be easier to guess.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The two different vulnerabilities have unrelated impacts. The first vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow that can cause a crash or allow for arbitrary remote code execution. The second vulnerability is an information disclosure issue where the function used by the <em>httpd</em> process may allow an attacker to guess each byte of a username and password deterministically.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. </p>
<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Netcomm router models NF20MESH, NF20, and NL1902 running software versions earlier than R6B035 contain two vulnerabilities.  The first is an authentication bypass vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated user to access content from both inside and outside the network. The second is a stack-based buffer overflow that allows an instruction pointer to be overwritten on the stack, thereby crashing the application at a known location. The two vulnerabilities, when chained together, permit a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code. </p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Netcomm router models NF20MESH, NF20, and NL1902 running software versions earlier than R6B035 may contain two vulnerabilities: </p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-4873</strong>
A stack based buffer overflow affects the sessionKey parameter. By providing a specific number of bytes, the instruction pointer is able to be overwritten on the stack and crashes the application at a known location.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-4874</strong>
Authentication bypass allows an unauthenticated user to access content. In order to serve static content, the application performs a check for the existence of specific characters in the URL (.css, .png etc). If it exists, it performs a "fake login" to give the request an active session to load the file and not redirect to the login page.</p>
<p>The tested models that were impacted are Netcomm routers using a Broadcom chipset that had third-party code added by Shenzhen Gongjin Electronics.  The third-party code introduced the vulnerabilities. These routers are  deployed by residential internet service providers.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The two vulnerabilities, when chained together, permit a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.  The attacker can first gain unauthorized access to affected devices, and then use those entry points to gain access to other networks or compromise the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of data being transmitted from the internal network. The reporter has produced a <a href="https://github.com/scarvell/advisories/blob/main/2022_netcomm_nf20mesh_unauth_rce.md">github PoC</a> that shows how to combine both vulnerabilities to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Update the router firmware to version R6B035 from the vendor website at <a href="https://support.netcommwireless.com/products/NF20#Firmware">https://support.netcommwireless.com/products/NF20#Firmware</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Author and public-interest security technologist Schneier (<em>Data and Goliath</em>, 2015) defines a “hack” as an activity allowed by a system “that subverts the rules or norms of the system [&#8230;] at the expense of someone else affected by the system.” In accessing the security of a particular system, technologists such as Schneier look at how it might fail. In order to counter a hack, it becomes necessary to think like a hacker. Schneier lays out the ramifications of a variety of hacks, contrasting the hacking of the tax code to benefit the wealthy with hacks in realms such as sports that can innovate and change a game for the better. The key to dealing with hacks is being proactive and providing adequate patches to fix any vulnerabilities. Schneier’s fascinating work illustrates how susceptible many systems are to being hacked and how lives can be altered by these subversions. Schneier’s deep dive into this cross-section of technology and humanity makes for investigative gold...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

<blockquote><p>Machine Generated Text: A Comprehensive Survey of Threat Models and Detection Methods</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Advances in natural language generation (NLG) have resulted in machine generated text that is increasingly difficult to distinguish from human authored text. Powerful open-source models are freely available, and user-friendly tools democratizing access to generative models are proliferating. The great potential of state-of-the-art NLG systems is tempered by the multitude of avenues for abuse. Detection of machine generated text is a key countermeasure for reducing abuse of NLG models, with significant technical challenges and numerous open problems. We provide a survey that includes both 1) an extensive analysis of threat models posed by contemporary NLG systems, and 2) the most complete review of machine generated text detection methods to date. This survey places machine generated text within its cybersecurity and social context, and provides strong guidance for future work addressing the most critical threat models, and ensuring detection systems themselves demonstrate trustworthiness through fairness, robustness, and  accountability...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: January 11, 2023
The United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK) has released a blog post, Using MSPs to administer your cloud services, that provides organizations security considerations for using a third party, such as a managed service provider (MSP), to administer cloud services. Contracting with an MSP for cloud service management has become an increasingly appealing option for organizations.
The post discusses the trade-offs involved as well as specific security checks organizations should make to confirm the MSP’s ability to defend against cyber threats.
CISA encourages organizations using MSPs for administering cloud services to implement the guidance NCSC-UK provides in the blog post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: January 10, 2023
CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[USN-5782-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The update introduced
several minor regressions. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that Firefox was using an out-of-date libusrsctp library.
 An attacker could possibly use this library to perform a reentrancy issue
 on Firefox. (CVE-2022-46871)
 
 Nika Layzell discovered that Firefox was not performing a check on paste
 received from cross-processes. An attacker could potentially exploit this
 to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2022-46872)
 
 Pete Freitag discovered that Firefox did not implement the unsafe-hashes
 CSP directive. An attacker who was able to inject markup into a page
 otherwise protected by a Content Security Policy may have been able to
 inject an executable script. (CVE-2022-46873)
 
 Matthias Zoellner discovered that Firefox was not keeping the filename
 ending intact when using the drag-and-drop event. An attacker could
 possibly use this issue to add a file with a malicious extension, leading
 to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-46874)
 
 Hafiizh discovered that Firefox was not handling fullscreen notifications
 when the browser window goes into fullscreen mode. An attacker could
 possibly use this issue to spoof the user and obtain sensitive information.
 (CVE-2022-46877)
 
 Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were
 tricked into opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
 potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive
 information across domains, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-46878, 
 CVE-2022-46879)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[USN-5782-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The update introduced
several minor regressions. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that Firefox was using an out-of-date libusrsctp library.
 An attacker could possibly use this library to perform a reentrancy issue
 on Firefox. (CVE-2022-46871)
 
 Nika Layzell discovered that Firefox was not performing a check on paste
 received from cross-processes. An attacker could potentially exploit this
 to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2022-46872)
 
 Pete Freitag discovered that Firefox did not implement the unsafe-hashes
 CSP directive. An attacker who was able to inject markup into a page
 otherwise protected by a Content Security Policy may have been able to
 inject an executable script. (CVE-2022-46873)
 
 Matthias Zoellner discovered that Firefox was not keeping the filename
 ending intact when using the drag-and-drop event. An attacker could
 possibly use this issue to add a file with a malicious extension, leading
 to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-46874)
 
 Hafiizh discovered that Firefox was not handling fullscreen notifications
 when the browser window goes into fullscreen mode. An attacker could
 possibly use this issue to spoof the user and obtain sensitive information.
 (CVE-2022-46877)
 
 Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were
 tricked into opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
 potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive
 information across domains, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-46878, 
 CVE-2022-46879)]]></summary>

While more devastating attacks on ear speakers, which produce much smaller scale vibrations, were believed impossible to eavesdrop with zero-permission motion sensors. In this work, we revisit this important line of reach. We explore recent trends in smartphone manufacturers that include extra/powerful speakers in place of small ear speakers, and demonstrate the feasibility of using motion sensors to capture such tiny speech vibrations. We investigate the impacts of these new ear speakers on built-in motion sensors and examine the potential to elicit private speech information from the minute vibrations. Our designed system ...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: December 29, 2022
CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.
