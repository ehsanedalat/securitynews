CVE-2023-6345 Google Skia Integer Overflow Vulnerability
CVE-2023-49103 ownCloud graphapi Information Disclosure Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

These are just three laptop models from the wide universe of PCs, but one of these three companies usually does make the fingerprint sensor in every laptop we&#8217;ve reviewed in the last few years.

discovered that the InfiniBand RDMA driver in the Linux kernel did not
properly check for zero-length STAG or MR registration. A remote attacker
could possibly use this to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-25775)

Yu Hao discovered that the UBI driver in the Linux kernel did not properly
check for MTD with zero erasesize during device attachment. A local
privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash). (CVE-2023-31085)

Manfred Rudigier discovered that the Intel(R) PCI-Express Gigabit (igb)
Ethernet driver in the Linux kernel did not properly validate received
frames that are larger than the set MTU size, leading to a buffer overflow
vulnerability. An attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-45871)

Maxim Levitsky discovered that the KVM nested virtualization (SVM)
implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel did not properly
handle x2AVIC MSRs. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a
denial of service (host kernel crash). (CVE-2023-5090)

It was discovered that the SMB network file sharing protocol implementation
in the Linux kernel did not properly handle certain error conditions,
leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A local attacker could use this
to cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary
code. (CVE-2023-5345)]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, in a landmark collaboration, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) are proud to announce the release of the Guidelines for Secure AI System Development. Co-sealed by 23 domestic and international cybersecurity organizations, this publication marks a significant step in addressing the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, and critical infrastructure.
The Guidelines, complementing the U.S. Voluntary Commitments on Ensuring Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI, provide essential recommendations for AI system development and emphasize the importance of adhering to Secure by Design principles. The approach prioritizes ownership of security outcomes for customers, embraces radical transparency and accountability, and establishes organizational structures where secure design is a top priority.
The Guidelines apply to all types of AI systems, not just frontier models. We provide suggestions and mitigations that will help data scientists, developers, managers, decision-makers, and risk owners make informed decisions about the secure design, model development, system development, deployment, and operation of their machine learning AI systems.
This document is aimed primarily at providers of AI systems, whether based on models hosted by an organization or making use of external application programming interfaces. However, we urge all stakeholders—including data scientists, developers, managers, decision-makers, and risk owners make—to read this guidance to help them make informed decisions about the design, deployment, and operation of their machine learning AI systems.
CISA invites stakeholders, partners, and the public to explore the Guidelines for Secure AI System Development as well as our recently published Roadmap for AI to learn more about our strategic vision for AI technology and cybersecurity. To access learn more, visit CISA.gov/AI.]]></summary>

Labeled Citrix Bleed, the vulnerability affects Citrix’s NetScaler web application delivery control (ADC) and NetScaler Gateway appliances.
Historically, LockBit affiliates have conducted attacks against organizations of varying sizes across multiple critical infrastructure sectors—including education, energy, financial services, food and agriculture, government and emergency services, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. The joint CSA provides tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), as well as indicators of compromise (IOCs).
If compromise is detected, the authoring organizations encourage network defenders hunt for malicious activity on their networks using the detection methods and IOCs provided within the CSA and apply the incident response recommendations. Additionally, immediate application of publicly available patches is also recommended. For more information, visit StopRansomware and see the updated #StopRansomware Guide.]]></summary>

CVE-2023-4911 GNU C Library Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>
