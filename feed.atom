<p>At around 10 a.m., a nearby resident spotted the squid at Ugu beach in Obama, Fukui Prefecture, on the Sea of Japan coast. According to the Obama Municipal Government, the squid was still alive when it was found. It is unusual for a giant squid to be washed ashore alive, officials said.</p>
<p>The deep-sea creature will be transported to Echizen Matsushima Aquarium in the prefectural city of Sakai.</p></blockquote>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> In the post-pandemic era, video conferencing apps (VCAs) have converted previously private spaces &#8212; bedrooms, living rooms, and kitchens &#8212; into semi-public extensions of the office. And for the most part, users have accepted these apps in their personal space, without much thought about the permission models that govern the use of their personal data during meetings. While access to a device’s video camera is carefully controlled, little has been done to ensure the same level of privacy for accessing the microphone. In this work, we ask the question: what happens to the microphone data when a user clicks the mute button in a VCA? We first conduct a user study to analyze users&#8217; understanding of the permission model of the mute button. Then, using runtime binary analysis tools, we trace raw audio in many popular VCAs as it traverses the app from the audio driver to the network. We find fragmented policies for dealing with microphone data among VCAs &#8212; some continuously monitor the microphone input during mute, and others do so periodically. One app transmits statistics of the audio to its telemetry servers while the app is muted. Using network traffic that we intercept en route to the telemetry server, we implement a proof-of-concept background activity classifier and demonstrate the feasibility of inferring the ongoing background activity during a meeting &#8212; cooking, cleaning, typing, etc. We achieved 81.9% macro accuracy on identifying six common background activities using intercepted outgoing telemetry packets when a user is muted...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

<p>Tychon contains a privilege escalation vulnerability due to the use of an <code>OPENSSLDIR</code> variable that specifies a location where an unprivileged Windows user may be able to place files.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Tychon includes an OpenSSL component that specifies an <code>OPENSSLDIR</code> variable as a subdirectory that my be controllable by an unprivileged user on Windows. Tychon contains a privileged service that uses this OpenSSL component. A user who can place a specially-crafted <code>openssl.cnf</code> file at an appropriate path may be able to achieve arbitrary code execution with SYSTEM privileges.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>By placing a specially-crafted <code>openssl.cnf</code> in a location used by Tychon, an unprivileged user may be able to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on a Windows system with the vulnerable Tychon software installed.</p>

        <id>https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/411271</id>
        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/411271"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Prior to version 5.14, Qt hard-codes the <code>qt_prfxpath</code> value to a fixed value, which may lead to privilege escalation vulnerabilities in Windows software that uses Qt.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Prior to version 5.14, Qt hard-codes the <code>qt_prfxpath</code> value to a value that reflects the path where Qt exists on the system that was used to build Qt. For example, it may refer to a specific subdirectory within <code>C:\Qt\</code>, which is the default installation location for Qt on Windows. If software that is built with Qt runs with privileges on a Windows system, this may allow for privilege escalation due to the fact that Windows by default allows unprivileged users to create subdirectories off of the root <code>C:\</code> drive location.</p>
<p>In 2015, a <a href="https://codereview.qt-project.org/gitweb?p=qt%2Fqttools.git&amp;a=commit&amp;h=c2952ff8df1e18fe0120d8b29901b0b794afccc7">patch</a> was made to <a href="https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/windows-deployment.html">windeployqt</a> to strip out any existing <code>qt_prfxpath</code> value from <code>Qt5Core.dll</code>. If Windows software that uses Qt prior to version 5.14 is not properly packaged using windeployqt, then it may be vulnerable to privilege escalation.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>By placing a file in an appropriate location on a Windows system, an unprivileged attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the software that uses Qt.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<h4 id="apply-an-update">Apply an update</h4>
<p>This issue is addressed in Qt 5.14. Starting with this version, Qt no longer hard-codes the <code>qt_prfxpath</code> value in <code>Qt5Core.dll</code>.</p>
<h4 id="run-windeployqt-to-prepare-windows-qt-software-for-deployment">Run windeployqt to prepare Windows Qt software for deployment</h4>
<p>The windeployqt utility will replace the <code>qt_prfxpath</code> value in the Qt core DLL with the value of <code>.</code>, which helps prevent this path from being used to achieve privilege escalation.</p>

It was discovered that Thunderbird ignored OpenPGP revocation when

potentially exploit this by tricking the user into trusting the
authenticity of a message or tricking them into use a revoked key to

<p>Google:</p>
<blockquote><p>2021 included the detection and disclosure of 58 in-the-wild 0-days, the most ever recorded since Project Zero began tracking in mid-2014. That’s more than double the previous maximum of 28 detected in 2015 and especially stark when you consider that there were only 25 detected in 2020. We’ve tracked publicly known in-the-wild 0-day exploits in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lkNJ0uQwbeC1ZTRrxdtuPLCIl7mlUreoKfSIgajnSyY/edit#gid=0">this spreadsheet</a> since mid-2014.</p>
<p>While we often talk about the number of 0-day exploits used in-the-wild, what we’re actually discussing is the number of 0-day exploits detected and disclosed as in-the-wild. And that leads into our first conclusion: we believe the large uptick in in-the-wild 0-days in 2021 is due to increased detection and disclosure of these 0-days, rather than simply increased usage of 0-day exploits...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

<blockquote><p>The vulnerability, which <a href="https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html">Oracle patched on Tuesday</a>, affects the company’s implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm">Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm</a> in Java versions 15 and above. ECDSA is an algorithm that uses the principles of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/10/a-relatively-easy-to-understand-primer-on-elliptic-curve-cryptography/">elliptic curve cryptography</a> to authenticate messages digitally.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>ECDSA signatures rely on a pseudo-random number, typically notated as K, that’s used to derive two additional numbers, R and S. To verify a signature as valid, a party must check the equation involving R and S, the signer’s public key, and a cryptographic hash of the message. When both sides of the equation are equal, the signature is valid. ...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The cybersecurity authorities of the United States, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to warn organizations that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could expose organizations both within and beyond the region to increased malicious cyber activity from Russian state-sponsored cyber actors or Russian-aligned cybercrime groups.
Joint CSA: Russian State-Sponsored and Criminal Cyber Threats to Critical Infrastructure, drafted with contributions from industry members of the Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative, provides an overview of Russian state-sponsored advanced persistent threat groups, Russian-aligned cyber threat groups, and Russian-aligned cybercrime groups to help the cybersecurity community protect against possible cyber threats.
U.S., Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, and UK cybersecurity authorities urge critical infrastructure network defenders to prepare for and mitigate potential cyber threats by hardening their cyber defenses as recommended in the joint CSA.
For more information on current and historical Russian-state-sponsored cyber activity and recommended mitigations, see the following CISA webpages:

Actions critical infrastructure organizations should implement to immediately protect against Russian state-sponsored and criminal cyber threats:
known exploited vulnerabilities.
The cybersecurity authorities of the United States[1][2][3], Australia[4], Canada[5], New Zealand[6], and the United Kingdom[7][8] are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA). The intent of this joint CSA is to warn organizations that Russia’s invasion of Ukraine could expose organizations both within and beyond the region to increased malicious cyber activity. This activity may occur as a response to the unprecedented economic costs imposed on Russia as well as materiel support provided by the United States and U.S. allies and partners.

CISA has added three new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow on the of the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
 Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract</b>: Given the computational cost and technical expertise required to train machine learning models, users may delegate the task of learning to a service provider. We show how a malicious learner can plant an undetectable backdoor into a classifier. On the surface, such a backdoored classifier behaves normally, but in reality, the learner maintains a mechanism for changing the classification of any input, with only a slight perturbation. Importantly, without the appropriate &#8220;backdoor key&#8221;, the mechanism is hidden and cannot be detected by any computationally-bounded observer. We demonstrate two frameworks for planting undetectable backdoors, with incomparable guarantees. ...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow on the of the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information. 
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

CISA has added eight new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow on the of the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

They could follow bitcoins on the blockchain as they moved from address to address until they reached one that could be tied to a known identity. In some cases, an investigator could learn someone&#8217;s Bitcoin addresses by transacting with them, the way an undercover narcotics agent might conduct a buy-and-bust. In other cases, they could trace a target&#8217;s coins to an account at a cryptocurrency exchange where financial regulations required users to prove their identity. A quick subpoena to the exchange from one of Chainalysis&#8217; customers in law enforcement was then enough to strip away any illusion of Bitcoin&#8217;s anonymity...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>
