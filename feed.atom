CVE-2023-49897 FXC AE1021, AE1021PE OS Command Injection Vulnerability
CVE-2023-47565 QNAP VioStor NVR OS Command Injection Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

Today’s release incorporates stakeholder input from last year’s public comment period and pilot effort with federal agencies. Changes to the draft Microsoft 365 Secure Configuration Baselines were integrated with the SCuBAGear tool, which is also now more automated to reduce organization effort.
CISA thanks all whose input took this guidance from a series of best practices to actionable policies and made the SCuBAGear tool easier to use.
Organizations are urged to review these baselines and utilize the SCuBAGear tool. For more information, read CISA’s blog and contact CISA’s Cybersecurity Shared Services Office for additional support.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), #StopRansomware: ALPHV Blackcat, to disseminate known ALPHV Blackcat affiliates’ tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) identified through FBI investigations as recently as Dec. 6, 2023. The advisory also provides updates to the FBI FLASH BlackCat/ALPHV Ransomware Indicators of Compromise released April 19, 2022.
ALPHV Blackcat affiliates have extensive networks and experience with ransomware and data extortion operations. FBI investigations, as of September 2023, place the number of compromised entities at over 1000—over half of which are in the United States and approximately 250 outside the United States.
CISA and FBI encourage critical infrastructure organizations to review and implement the mitigations provided in the joint CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of ALPHV Blackcat ransomware and data extortion incidents. For more information, see CISA’s #StopRansomware webpage, which includes the updated #StopRansomware Guide.]]></summary>

Take ownership of customer security outcomes.
Build organizational structure and leadership to achieve these goals. 
By implementing these two principles in their design, development, and delivery processes, software manufactures will prevent exploitation of static default passwords in their customers’ systems.

Since September 2023, Russian Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR)-affiliated cyber actors (also known as Advanced Persistent Threat 29 (APT 29), the Dukes, CozyBear, and NOBELIUM/Midnight Blizzard) have been targeting servers hosting JetBrains TeamCity software that ultimately enabled them to bypass authorization and conduct arbitrary code execution on the compromised server. The joint CSA provides information on the SVR’s most recent compromise, actionable indicators of compromise (IOCs), and SIGMA and YARA rules.
The authoring agencies encourage network defenders and organizations review the joint CSA for recommended mitigations and rules. For more information on affiliated advanced persistent threats, see CISA’s Advanced Persistent Threats and Nation-State Actors and Russia Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpages.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, CISA released the draft Secure Cloud Business Applications (SCuBA) Google Workspace (GWS) Secure Configuration Baselines and the associated assessment tool ScubaGoggles for public comment. The draft baselines offer minimum viable security configurations for nine GWS services: Groups for Business, Google Calendar, Google Common Controls, Google Classroom, Google Meet, Gmail, Google Chat, Google Drive and Docs, and Google Sites. The ScubaGoggles tool assesses GWS tenants' compliance against the baselines.   
Federal agencies and other organizations are invited to adopt the draft baselines in their GWS environments, tailor them to reflect their own unique needs and risk tolerances, and then share their experiences with CISA during the public comment period, which closes Jan. 12, 2024. Comments will ensure that the final published baselines are clear, feasible, and effective.  
The draft SCuBA GWS Secure Configuration Baselines is the latest offering from CISA’s SCuBA project, dedicated to securing data stored in the cloud through additional configurations, settings, and security products. These baselines are created in accordance with Executive Order 14028 to provide enhanced visibility into cloud security.  
Comment on SCuBA GWS Secure Configuration Baselines by Jan. 12, 2024. For more information, read CISA Seeks Public Comment on Newly Developed Secure Configuration Baselines for Google Workspace and visit CISA’s SCuBA project page.]]></summary>

CVE-2023-6448 Unitronics Vision PLC and HMI Insecure Default Password 
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

CVE-2023-41265 Qlik Sense HTTP Tunneling Vulnerability
CVE-2023-41266 Qlik Sense Path Traversal Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)—in coordination with the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (UK-NCSC), Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ), and the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Cyber Command Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF)—released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) Russian FSB Cyber Actor Star Blizzard Continues Worldwide Spear-phishing Campaigns. The joint CSA aims to raise awareness of the specific tactics, techniques, and delivery methods used by this Russia-based threat actor group to target individuals and organizations. Known Star Blizzard techniques include:
Impersonating known contacts' email accounts,
Creating fake social media profiles,
Using webmail addresses from providers such as Outlook, Gmail and others, and
Creating malicious domains that resemble legitimate organizations.
CISA encourages network defenders and critical infrastructure organizations review the CSA to improve their cybersecurity posture and protect against similar exploitation based on threat actor activity. CISA also urges software manufacturers to incorporate secure-by-design and -default principles into their software development practices, limiting the impact of threat actor activity.

        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/811862"/>
        <updated>2023-12-06T18:59:53.288Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Implementation of Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) by Vendors provide a way to customize logo image displayed during the early boot phase. Binarly has uncovered vulnerabilities in the image parsing libraries that provide this capability. An attacker with local privileged access can exploit these vulnerability to modify UEFI settings. </p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>UEFI firmware provides an extensible interface between an operating system and hardware platform. UEFI software stores a number of settings and files in a customized Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI)  partition known as EFI system partition (ESP).  ESP is a special privileged file system that is independent of the OS and essentially acts as the storage place for the UEFI boot loaders, applications, hardware drivers and customizable settings to be launched by the UEFI firmware. The ESP partition is mandatory for UEFI boot and is protected from unprivileged access.  The information stored in ESP is probed and processed during <a href="https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/media/images/figure3_08012022.max-1280x720.format-webp.webp"> the early phases of an UEFI based OS</a>.  One such information stored in the ESP is a personalizable  boot logo. </p>
<p>Binarly has discovered a number of vulnerabilities in the image parsing libraries that read and process these image files. As these files are processed by executables that run under a high privilege, it is possible to exploit these vulnerabilities in order to access and modify high-privileged UEFI settings of a device. UEFI supply-chain allows for many of these shared libraries to be integrated in various ways, including compiled from source, licensed for modification and reuse and finally as a dynamic or static linked executable. Binarly has also observed that in some cases an attacker can create a bundled firmware update that contains a corrupt or malicious image to trigger these vulnerabilities.  This can also allow an attacker to exploit vulnerability while flashing the PCI with a firmware update.  Due to the complex nature of these vulnerabilities and their potential wide impact, Binarly would like to use the label <code>LogoFAIL</code> to track and support coordination and mitigation of these vulnerabilities.  </p>
<p>Note: Multiple CVE's may be applied to these set of vulnerabilities due to many implementations and potential customization of the libraries and sources that introduce these weaknesses. Please check the Vendor Information section for details provided by various vendors for mitigation and fixes.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The impacts of these vulnerabilities vary widely due to the nature of the UEFI software and various implementations through the supply-chain. </p>
<p>In summary, a local attacker with administrative privileges to the ESP partition or to the firmware flash can use malicious images to perform any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable UEFI security features (SecureBoot)</li>
<li>Modify the UEFI Boot Order or the designated Boot Partition</li>
<li>Execute unwanted software to infect protected Operating System</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, attacker can use the vendor provided logo customization interface to upload these malicious images.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p><strong>Apply Updates</strong></p>
<p>Multiple vendors from the supply-chain have provided their solution to these vulnerabilities and have provided software updates to address them.  Please verify your vendor provided Statement and their solution below with any reference or additional information to address this issue.</p>
<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>Thanks to Binarly for reporting these vulnerabilities. We would also like to thank multiple vendors from the UEFI supply-chain cooperated to address these issues</p>

We will show that it has some useful properties that in addition to being interesting in themselves, also suggest that its fundamental design principle is worth investigating for application to leader election protocols in computer science. For example, it gives some opportunities to minorities while ensuring that more popular candidates are more likely to win, and offers some resistance to corruption of voters...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, as part of the Secure by Design campaign, CISA published The Case for Memory Safe Roadmaps: Why Both C-Suite Executives and Technical Experts Need to Take Memory Safe Coding Seriously in collaboration with the following partners:
United States National Security Agency
United States Federal Bureau of Investigation
Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre
Canadian Centre for Cyber Security
United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre
New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre
Computer Emergency Response Team New Zealand
Malicious cyber actors routinely exploit memory safety vulnerabilities, which are common coding errors and the most prevalent type of disclosed software vulnerability. Preventing and responding to these vulnerabilities cost both software manufacturers and their customer organizations significant time and resources.
The Case for Memory Safe Roadmaps details how software manufacturers can transition to memory safe programming languages (MSLs) to eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities. The guidance provides manufacturers steps for creating and publishing memory safe roadmaps that will show their customers how they are owning security outcomes, embracing radical transparency, and taking a top-down approach to developing secure products—key Secure by Design tenets.
CISA and our partners urge C-suite and technical experts at software manufacturers to read this guidance and implement memory safe roadmaps to eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities from their product.

If I hired a private detective to spy on you, that detective could hide a bug in your home or car, tap your phone, and listen to what you said. At the end, I would get a report of all the conversations you had and the contents of those conversations. If I hired that same private detective to put you under surveillance, I would get a different report: where you went, whom you talked to, what you purchased, what you did.</p>
<p>Before the internet, putting someone under surveillance was expensive and time-consuming. You had to manually follow someone around, noting where they went, whom they talked to, what they purchased, what they did, and what they read. That world is forever gone. Our phones track our locations. Credit cards track our purchases. Apps track whom we talk to, and e-readers know what we read. Computers collect data about what we&#8217;re doing on them, and as both storage and processing have become cheaper, that data is increasingly saved and used.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added four new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2023-33106 Qualcomm Multiple Chipsets Use of Out-of-Range Pointer Offset Vulnerability
CVE-2023-33063 Qualcomm Multiple Chipsets Use-After-Free Vulnerability
CVE-2023-33107 Qualcomm Multiple Chipsets Integer Overflow Vulnerability
CVE-2022-22071 Qualcomm Multiple Chipsets Use-After-Free Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2023-42917 Apple Multiple Products WebKit Memory Corruption Vulnerability
CVE-2023-42916 Apple Multiple Products WebKit Out-of-Bounds Read Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has assisted a researcher with coordinating the disclosure of multiple researcher-discovered vulnerabilities affecting web-based case and document management systems used by multiple state, county, and municipal courts. Affected systems include products from Tyler Technologies and Catalis and custom software used by specific counties in Florida. In summary, the vulnerabilities allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive documents by manipulating identifiers and file names in URLs. CISA understands that some of the vulnerabilities may have been mitigated. Further information is available in the researcher’s disclosure and a corresponding article.
CISA encourages users and administrators to apply security updates as they become available for the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2023-6345 Google Skia Integer Overflow Vulnerability
CVE-2023-49103 ownCloud graphapi Information Disclosure Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>
