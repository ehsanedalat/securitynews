<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> In this paper we describe how to plant novel types of backdoors in any facial recognition model based on the popular architecture of deep Siamese neural networks, by mathematically changing a small fraction of its weights (i.e., without using any additional training or optimization). These backdoors force the system to err only on specific persons which are preselected by the attacker. For example, we show how such a backdoored system can take any two images of a particular person and decide that they represent different persons (an anonymity attack), or take any two images of a particular pair of persons and decide that they represent the same person (a confusion attack), with almost no effect on the correctness of its decisions for other persons. Uniquely, we show that multiple backdoors can be independently installed by multiple attackers who may not be aware of each other&#8217;s existence with almost no interference...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: February 2, 2023
CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <updated>2023-01-26T21:36:01.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[USN-5822-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Samba. The update for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
introduced regressions in certain environments. Pending investigation of
these regressions, this update temporarily reverts the security fixes.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that Samba incorrectly handled the bad password count
 logic. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to bypass bad
 passwords lockouts. This issue was only addressed in Ubuntu 22.10.
 (CVE-2021-20251)
 
 Evgeny Legerov discovered that Samba incorrectly handled buffers in
 certain GSSAPI routines of Heimdal. A remote attacker could possibly use
 this issue to cause Samba to crash, resulting in a denial of service.
 (CVE-2022-3437)
 
 Tom Tervoort discovered that Samba incorrectly used weak rc4-hmac Kerberos
 keys. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to elevate
 privileges. (CVE-2022-37966, CVE-2022-37967)
 
 It was discovered that Samba supported weak RC4/HMAC-MD5 in NetLogon Secure
 Channel. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue to elevate
 privileges. (CVE-2022-38023)
 
 Greg Hudson discovered that Samba incorrectly handled PAC parsing. On
 32-bit systems, a remote attacker could use this issue to escalate
 privileges, or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42898)
 
 Joseph Sutton discovered that Samba could be forced to issue rc4-hmac
 encrypted Kerberos tickets. A remote attacker could possibly use this issue
 to escalate privileges. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and
 Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-45141)
 
 WARNING: The fixes included in these updates introduce several important
 behavior changes which may cause compatibility problems interacting with
 systems still expecting the former behavior. Please see the following
 upstream advisories for more information:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: January 26, 2023
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and poses a significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) released joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) Protecting Against Malicious Use of Remote Monitoring and Management Software. The advisory describes a phishing scam in which cyber threat actors maliciously use legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) software to steal money from victim bank accounts.
CISA encourages network defenders to review the advisory for indicators of compromise, best practices, and recommended mitigations, which highlights the threat of additional types of malicious activity using RMM, including its use as a backdoor for persistence and/or command and control (C2).

Summary
The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), National Security Agency (NSA), and Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) (hereafter referred to as the “authoring organizations”) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to warn network defenders about malicious use of legitimate remote monitoring and management (RMM) software. In October 2022, CISA identified a widespread cyber campaign involving the malicious use of legitimate RMM software. Specifically, cyber criminal actors sent phishing emails that led to the download of legitimate RMM software—ScreenConnect (now ConnectWise Control) and AnyDesk—which the actors used in a refund scam to steal money from victim bank accounts.

Today, CISA released Protecting Our Future: Partnering to Safeguard K–12 organizations from Cybersecurity Threats. The report provides recommendations and resources to help K-12 schools and school districts address systemic cybersecurity risk. It also provides insight into the current threat landscape specific to the K-12 community and offers simple steps school leaders can take to strengthen their cybersecurity efforts.
The report’s findings state that K-12 organizations need resources, simplicity and prioritization to effectively reduce their cybersecurity risk. To address these issues, CISA provides three recommendations in the report to help K-12 leaders build, operate, and maintain resilient cybersecurity programs:
Invest in the most impactful security measures and build toward a mature cybersecurity plan.
Recognize and actively address resource constraints.
Focus on collaboration and information-sharing.
Along with the report, we are providing an online toolkit which aligns resources and materials to each of CISA’s three recommendations along with guidance on how stakeholders can implement each recommendation based on their current needs. To read the full report and to access the toolkit, visit Protecting Our Future: Partnering to Safeguard K–12 organizations from Cybersecurity Threats.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: January 23, 2023
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and poses a significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

could disable web security opening restrictions, leading to a new child
process being spawned within the file:// context. An attacker could
potentially exploits this to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2023-23597)

Tom Schuster discovered that Firefox was not performing a validation check
on GTK drag data. An attacker could potentially exploits this to obtain
sensitive information. (CVE-2023-23598)

output when copying a network request from the developer tools panel. An
attacker could potentially exploits this to hide and execute arbitrary
commands. (CVE-2023-23599)

Luan Herrera discovered that Firefox was not stopping navigation when
dragging a URL from a cross-origin iframe into the same tab. An attacker
potentially exploits this to spoof the user. (CVE-2023-23601)

Dave Vandyke discovered that Firefox did not properly implement CSP policy
when creating a WebSocket in a WebWorker. An attacker who was able to
inject markup into a page otherwise protected by a Content Security Policy
may have been able to inject an executable script. (CVE-2023-23602)

Dan Veditz discovered that Firefox did not properly implement CSP policy
on regular expression when using console.log. An attacker potentially
exploits this to exfiltrate data from the browser. (CVE-2023-23603)

<blockquote><p>&#8220;Hacking is something that the rich and powerful do, something that reinforces existing power structures,&#8221; contends security technologist Schneier (<i>Click Here to Kill Everybody</i>) in this excellent survey of exploitation. Taking a broad understanding of hacking as an &#8220;activity allowed by the system that subverts the&#8230; system,&#8221; Schneier draws on his background analyzing weaknesses in cybersecurity to examine how those with power take advantage of financial, legal, political, and cognitive systems. He decries how venture capitalists “hack” market dynamics by subverting the pressures of supply and demand, noting that venture capital has kept Uber afloat despite the company having not yet turned a profit. Legal loopholes constitute another form of hacking, Schneier suggests, discussing how the inability of tribal courts to try non-Native individuals means that many sexual assaults of Native American women go unprosecuted because they were committed by non-Native American men. Schneier outlines strategies used by corporations to capitalize on neural processes and &#8220;hack&#8230; our attention circuits,&#8221; pointing out how Facebook&#8217;s algorithms boost content that outrages users because doing so increases engagement. Elegantly probing the mechanics of exploitation, Schneier makes a persuasive case that &#8220;we need society&#8217;s rules and laws to be as patchable as your computer.&#8221; With lessons that extend far beyond the tech world, this has much to offer...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

We present seven different attacks against the protocol in three different threat models. As one example, we present a cross-protocol attack which breaks authentication in Threema and which exploits the lack of proper key separation between different sub-protocols. As another, we demonstrate a compression-based side-channel attack that recovers users&#8217; long-term private keys through observation of the size of Threema encrypted back-ups. We discuss remediations for our attacks and draw three wider lessons for developers of secure protocols...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: January 17, 2023
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and poses a significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: January 17, 2023
Today, CISA updated Best Practices for MITRE ATT&CK® Mapping. The MITRE ATT&CK® framework is a lens through which network defenders can analyze adversary behavior and, as CISA Executive Assistant Director Eric Goldstein noted in his June 2021 blog post on the framework, it directly supports “robust, contextual bi-directional sharing of information to help strengthen the security of our systems, networks, and data.” CISA highly encourages the cybersecurity community to use the framework because it provides a common language for threat actor analysis.
CISA coordinated this update of the best practices with the Homeland Security Systems Engineering and Development Institute™ (HSSEDI), a DHS-owned R&D center operated by MITRE. The update covers changes that the MITRE ATT&CK team made to the framework since CISA initially published the best practices in June 2021. The update also covers common analytical biases, mapping mistakes, and specific ATT&CK mapping guidance for industrial control systems (ICS).

<p>TP-Link router WR710N-V1-151022 running firmware published 2015-10-22 and Archer-C5-V2-160201 running firmware published 2016-02-01 are susceptible to two vulnerabilities:</p>
<ol>
<li>A buffer overflow during HTTP Basic Authentication allowing a remote attacker to corrupt memory allocated on a heap causing denial of service or arbitrary code execution;</li>
<li>A side-channel attack via a <em>strcmp()</em> function in the HTTP daemon allowing deterministic guessing of each byte of a username and password input during authentication.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>TP-Link device WR710N-V1-151022 is a 150Mbps Wireless N Mini Pocket router, and Archer-C5-V2-160201 is a Wireless Dual Band Gigabit router. These SOHO devices are sold by TP-Link and their latest firmware available as of January 11, 2023, have two vulnerabilities. </p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-4498</strong>
When receiving user input during HTTP Basic Authentication mode, a crafted packet may cause a heap overflow in the <em>httpd</em> daemon. This can lead to denial of service (DoS) if the <em>httpd</em> process crashes or arbitrary remote code execution (RCE).</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-4499</strong>
A <em>strcmp()</em> function in <em>httpd</em>, is susceptible to a side-channel attack when used to verify usename and password credentials. By measuring the response time of the vulnerable process, each byte of the username and password strings may be easier to guess.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The two different vulnerabilities have unrelated impacts. The first vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow that can cause a crash or allow for arbitrary remote code execution. The second vulnerability is an information disclosure issue where the function used by the <em>httpd</em> process may allow an attacker to guess each byte of a username and password deterministically.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solution to this problem. </p>

<p>Netcomm router models NF20MESH, NF20, and NL1902 running software versions earlier than R6B035 contain two vulnerabilities.  The first is an authentication bypass vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated user to access content from both inside and outside the network. The second is a stack-based buffer overflow that allows an instruction pointer to be overwritten on the stack, thereby crashing the application at a known location. The two vulnerabilities, when chained together, permit a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code. </p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Netcomm router models NF20MESH, NF20, and NL1902 running software versions earlier than R6B035 may contain two vulnerabilities: </p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-4873</strong>
A stack based buffer overflow affects the sessionKey parameter. By providing a specific number of bytes, the instruction pointer is able to be overwritten on the stack and crashes the application at a known location.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-4874</strong>
Authentication bypass allows an unauthenticated user to access content. In order to serve static content, the application performs a check for the existence of specific characters in the URL (.css, .png etc). If it exists, it performs a "fake login" to give the request an active session to load the file and not redirect to the login page.</p>
<p>The tested models that were impacted are Netcomm routers using a Broadcom chipset that had third-party code added by Shenzhen Gongjin Electronics.  The third-party code introduced the vulnerabilities. These routers are  deployed by residential internet service providers.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The two vulnerabilities, when chained together, permit a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code.  The attacker can first gain unauthorized access to affected devices, and then use those entry points to gain access to other networks or compromise the availability, integrity, or confidentiality of data being transmitted from the internal network. The reporter has produced a <a href="https://github.com/scarvell/advisories/blob/main/2022_netcomm_nf20mesh_unauth_rce.md">github PoC</a> that shows how to combine both vulnerabilities to achieve unauthenticated remote code execution.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Update the router firmware to version R6B035 from the vendor website at <a href="https://support.netcommwireless.com/products/NF20#Firmware">https://support.netcommwireless.com/products/NF20#Firmware</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Author and public-interest security technologist Schneier (<em>Data and Goliath</em>, 2015) defines a “hack” as an activity allowed by a system “that subverts the rules or norms of the system [&#8230;] at the expense of someone else affected by the system.” In accessing the security of a particular system, technologists such as Schneier look at how it might fail. In order to counter a hack, it becomes necessary to think like a hacker. Schneier lays out the ramifications of a variety of hacks, contrasting the hacking of the tax code to benefit the wealthy with hacks in realms such as sports that can innovate and change a game for the better. The key to dealing with hacks is being proactive and providing adequate patches to fix any vulnerabilities. Schneier’s fascinating work illustrates how susceptible many systems are to being hacked and how lives can be altered by these subversions. Schneier’s deep dive into this cross-section of technology and humanity makes for investigative gold...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

This <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.07321.pdf">paper</a> is a good survey of the field: what the threats are, how we might detect machine-generated text, directions for future research. It&#8217;s a solid grounding amongst all of the hype.</p>
<blockquote><p>Machine Generated Text: A Comprehensive Survey of Threat Models and Detection Methods</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Advances in natural language generation (NLG) have resulted in machine generated text that is increasingly difficult to distinguish from human authored text. Powerful open-source models are freely available, and user-friendly tools democratizing access to generative models are proliferating. The great potential of state-of-the-art NLG systems is tempered by the multitude of avenues for abuse. Detection of machine generated text is a key countermeasure for reducing abuse of NLG models, with significant technical challenges and numerous open problems. We provide a survey that includes both 1) an extensive analysis of threat models posed by contemporary NLG systems, and 2) the most complete review of machine generated text detection methods to date. This survey places machine generated text within its cybersecurity and social context, and provides strong guidance for future work addressing the most critical threat models, and ensuring detection systems themselves demonstrate trustworthiness through fairness, robustness, and  accountability...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK) has released a blog post, Using MSPs to administer your cloud services, that provides organizations security considerations for using a third party, such as a managed service provider (MSP), to administer cloud services. Contracting with an MSP for cloud service management has become an increasingly appealing option for organizations.
The post discusses the trade-offs involved as well as specific security checks organizations should make to confirm the MSP’s ability to defend against cyber threats.
CISA encourages organizations using MSPs for administering cloud services to implement the guidance NCSC-UK provides in the blog post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: January 10, 2023
CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[USN-5782-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The update introduced
several minor regressions. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that Firefox was using an out-of-date libusrsctp library.
 An attacker could possibly use this library to perform a reentrancy issue
 on Firefox. (CVE-2022-46871)
 
 Nika Layzell discovered that Firefox was not performing a check on paste
 received from cross-processes. An attacker could potentially exploit this
 to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2022-46872)
 
 Pete Freitag discovered that Firefox did not implement the unsafe-hashes
 CSP directive. An attacker who was able to inject markup into a page
 otherwise protected by a Content Security Policy may have been able to
 inject an executable script. (CVE-2022-46873)
 
 Matthias Zoellner discovered that Firefox was not keeping the filename
 ending intact when using the drag-and-drop event. An attacker could
 possibly use this issue to add a file with a malicious extension, leading
 to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-46874)
 
 Hafiizh discovered that Firefox was not handling fullscreen notifications
 when the browser window goes into fullscreen mode. An attacker could
 possibly use this issue to spoof the user and obtain sensitive information.
 (CVE-2022-46877)
 
 Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were
 tricked into opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
 potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive
 information across domains, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-46878, 
 CVE-2022-46879)]]></summary>
