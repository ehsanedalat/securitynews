        <id>https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/417980</id>
        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/417980"/>
        <updated>2024-03-19T19:49:45.063Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>A novel traffic-loop vulnerability has been identified against certain implementations of UDP-based applications protocols.  An unauthenticated attacker can use maliciously-crafted packets against a UDP-based vulnerable implementation of application protocols (e.g., DNS, NTP, TFTP) that can lead to Denial-of-Service (DOS) and/or abuse of resources.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The User Datagram Protocol (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc768">UDP</a>) is a simple, connectionless protocol that is still commonly used in many internet-based applications. UDP has a limited packet-verification capability and is susceptible to IP spoofing.  Security researchers have identified that certain implementations of the UDP protocol in applications can be triggered to create a network-loop of seemingly never-ending packets. Software implementations of UDP-based application protocols DNS, NTP, TFTP, Echo (RFC862), Chargen (RFC864), and QOTD (RFC865) were specifically found to be vulnerable to such network loops. </p>
<p>As an example, if two application servers have a vulnerable implementation of said protocol, an attacker can initiate a communication with the first server, spoofing the network address of the second server (victim). In many cases, the first server will respond with an error message to the victim, which will also trigger a similar behavior of another error message back to the first server. This behavior has been demonstrated to be resource exhausting and can cause services to become either unresponsive or unstable.  </p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could result in the following scenarios: 
1. Overload of a vulnerable service, causing it to become unstable or unusable.
2. DOS attack of the network backbone, causing network outage to other services.
3. Amplification attacks that involve network loops causing amplified DOS or DDOS attacks.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<h4 id="apply-updates">Apply updates</h4>
<p>CERT/CC recommends that you apply the latest patch provided by the affected vendor that addresses this vulnerability in the vendor-specific implementations. Review the vendor-specific information below. If the product is end-of-life/unsupported, vendors will be unlikely to release a patch; thus, we recommend replacing the device.</p>
<h4 id="protect-or-replace-udp-applications">Protect or replace UDP applications</h4>
<p>When possible, protect UDP-based applications using network firewall rules and/or other access-control lists to prevent unauthorized access. If the same service can be implemented using a TCP or with any request-validation capability (e.g., <a href="https://freeradius.org/rfc/rfc2869.html#Message-Authenticator">Message-Authenticator</a>) available in the UDP-based application protocol, implement such protection to prevent unknown or spoofed requests. It is recommended that you disable unnecessary and unused UDP services that may be enabled as part of your operating system to prevent exposure of these services for abuse.</p>
<h4 id="deploy-anti-spoofing">Deploy anti-spoofing</h4>
<p>Network providers should deploy available anti-spoofing techniques (<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp38">BCP38</a>) such as Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3704">uRPF</a>) to prevent IP spoofing in protecting their internet-facing resources against spoofing and abuse.  </p>
<h4 id="enforce-network-rate-limiting">Enforce network rate-limiting</h4>
<p>Service providers should employ network rate-limiting capabilities, such Quality-of-Service (QoS) to protect their network from abuse from network loops and amplifications and to ensure their critical resources/services are protected.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, CISA, the National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and other U.S. and international partners are issuing a joint fact sheet, People’s Republic of China State-Sponsored Cyber Activity: Actions for Critical Infrastructure Leaders. Partners of this publication include: 
U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) 
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 
U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) 
U.S. Department of Treasury  
Australian Signals Directorate’s (ASD’s) Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) 
Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS) a part of the Communications Security Establishment (CSE) 
United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-UK) 
New Zealand’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ) 
The U.S. authoring agencies assess that the PRC-sponsored advanced persistent threat group known as “Volt Typhoon” are seeking to pre-position themselves—using living off the land (LOTL) techniques—on IT networks for disruptive or destructive cyber activity against U.S. critical infrastructure in the event of a major crisis or conflict with the United States. The fact sheet warns critical infrastructure leaders of the urgent risk posed by Volt Typhoon and provides guidance on specific actions to prioritize the protection of their organization from this threat activity.  
CISA and its partners strongly urge critical infrastructure organizations leaders to read the guidance provided in the joint fact sheet to defend against this threat. For more information on Volt Typhoon related activity, see PRC State-Sponsored Actors Compromise and Maintain Persistent Access to U.S. Critical Infrastructure alongside supplemental Joint Guidance: Identifying and Mitigating Living off the Land Techniques.

academylms -- academy_lms_-_elearning_and_online_course_solution_for_wordpress
The Academy LMS - eLearning and online course solution for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to, and including, 1.9.19. This is due to plugin allowing arbitrary user meta updates through the saved_user_info() function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with minimal permissions such as students, to elevate their user role to that of an administrator.

<blockquote><p>The immediate problem &#8220;is&#8221; that it’s Too Easy By Default™ to write security and safety vulnerabilities in C++ that would have been caught by stricter enforcement of known rules for <i>type, bounds, initialization</i>, and <i>lifetime</i> language safety.</p></blockquote>
<p>His conclusion:</p>
<blockquote><p>We need to improve software security and software safety across the industry, especially by improving programming language safety in C and C++, and in C++ a 98% improvement in the four most common problem areas is achievable in the medium term. But if we focus on programming language safety alone, we may find ourselves fighting yesterday’s war and missing larger past and future security dangers that affect software written in any language...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>A Speculative Race Condition (SRC) vulnerability that impacts modern CPU architectures supporting speculative execution has been discovered. CPU hardware utilizing speculative execution that are vulnerable to Spectre v1 are likely affected. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability to disclose arbitrary data from the CPU using race conditions to access the speculative executable code paths. Security researchers have labeled this variant of the Spectre v1 vulnerability “GhostRace", for ease of communication. </p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Speculative execution is an optimization technique where a computer system performs some task preemptively to improve performance and provide additional concurrency as and when extra resources are available. However, these speculative executions leave traces of memory accesses or computations in the CPU’s cache, buffer, and branch predictors. Attackers can take advantage of these and, in some cases, also influence speculative execution paths via malicious software to infer privileged data that is part of a distinct execution. Attackers exploiting Spectre v1 take advantage of the speculative execution of conditional branch instructions used for memory access bounds checks. These are discussed in some amount of detail in the article <a href="https://docs.kernel.org/admin-guide/hw-vuln/spectre.html">Spectre Side Channels</a> found at kernel.org.  The earlier research did not include any of the speculative execution attacks using race conditions. Race conditions, generally considered part of concurrency bugs, occur when two or more threads attempt to access the same, shared resource without proper synchronization, which can create an opportunity for an attacker to trick a system into carrying out unauthorized actions in addition to its normal processes. This recent research explores a speculative race condition attack against the speculative execution facility of the modern CPUs.</p>
<p>In characteristics and exploitation strategy, an SRC vulnerability is similar to a classic race condition. However, it is different in that the attacker exploits said race condition on a transiently executed path originating from a mis-speculated branch (similar to Spectre v1), targeting a racy code snippet or gadget that ultimately discloses information to the attacker.  Another major difference is that while classic race conditions are relatively infrequent in production code bases, speculative race conditions can be pervasive. Common synchronization primitives all exhibit no-op-like behavior on a transiently executed path, essentially causing any of the critical regions in victim software to become vulnerable. In practice, whether a particular critical region is actually exploitable or not depends on the characteristics of the resulting race condition, similar in some ways to the exploitation of the classic race condition. </p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker with access to CPU resources may be able to read arbitrary privileged data or system registry values by utilizing the race condition, termed as speculative race condition.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Please update your software according to the recommendations from respective vendors with the latest mitigations available to address this vulnerability and its variants. </p>

acowebs -- pdf_invoices_and_packing_slips_for_woocommerce
The PDF Invoices and Packing Slips For WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to PHP Object Injection in all versions up to, and including, 1.3.7 via deserialization of untrusted input via the order_id parameter. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to inject a PHP Object. No known POP chain is present in the vulnerable plugin. If a POP chain is present via an additional plugin or theme installed on the target system, it could allow the attacker to delete arbitrary files, retrieve sensitive data, or execute code.

LLMs through a Global Scale Prompt Hacking Competition</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> Large Language Models (LLMs) are deployed in interactive contexts with direct user engagement, such as chatbots and writing assistants. These deployments are vulnerable to prompt injection and jailbreaking (collectively, prompt hacking), in which models are manipulated to ignore their original instructions and follow potentially malicious ones. Although widely acknowledged as a significant security threat, there is a dearth of large-scale resources and quantitative studies on prompt hacking. To address this lacuna, we launch a global prompt hacking competition, which allows for free-form human input attacks. We elicit 600K+ adversarial prompts against three state-of-the-art LLMs. We describe the dataset, which empirically verifies that current LLMs can indeed be manipulated via prompt hacking. We also present a comprehensive taxonomical ontology of the types of adversarial prompts...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <id>https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/949046</id>
        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/949046"/>
        <updated>2024-03-07T14:49:15.807Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Kontrol and Elock locks are electronic locks that utilize firmware provided by Sciener. This firmware works in tandem with an app, called the TTLock app, which is also produced by Sciener. The TTLock app utilizes Bluetooth connections to connect to locks that utilize the Sciener firmware, and allows for manipulation of the lock. Sceiner firmware locks also supports peripherals. The GatewayG2, also produced by Sciener, allows for connection to an appropriate lock through the TTLock app through WiFi. Sciener firmware also allows wireless keypad connection to supported devices. </p>
<p>Analysis has revealed that the Kontrol and Elock locks are vulnerable through the Sciener firmware. Vulnerabilities within the TTLock App and GatewayG2 can be further utilized to compromise the associated electronic lock integrity. While Elock locks are vulnerable to attacks through the Sciener firmware, the Kontrol Lux lock, a specific lock model, has wireless vulnerabilities unique to it.</p>
<p>A number of these vulnerabilities are facilitated through the unlockKey character. The unlockKey character, when provided to the appropriate lock, can be used to unlock or lock the device. </p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The vulnerabilities are as follows:</p>
<p>•   CVE-2023-7006</p>
<p>The unlockKey character in a lock using Sciener firmware can be brute forced through repeated challenge requests, compromising the locks integrity. Challenge requests take place during the unlocking process, and contain a random integer between 0 and 65535. Challenge requests can be repeatedly prompted and responded to without any limitations, until the correct integer is discovered. Successfully completing the challenge request provides the unlockKey character.</p>
<p>•   CVE-2023-7005</p>
<p>A specially crafted message can be sent to the TTLock App that downgrades the encryption protocol used for communication and can be utilized to compromise the lock, such as by providing the unlockKey character. During the challenge request process, if a message is sent to the lock unencrypted, and with a specific set of information, the corresponding message that contains the unlockKey character will be provided unencrypted. </p>
<p>•   CVE-2023-7003</p>
<p>The AES key utilized in the pairing process between a lock using Sciener firmware and a wireless keypad is not unique, and can be reused compromise other locks using the Sciener firmware. This AES key can be utilized to connect to any other Sciener lock that supports wireless keypads, without user knowledge or interaction. </p>
<p>•   CVE-2023-6960</p>
<p>The TTLock App supports the creation of virtual keys and settings. They virtual keys are intended to be distributed to other individuals through the TTLock app, for unlocking and locking the lock. They can also be set to only be valid for a certain period of time. Deletion of these keys only occurs client side in the TTLock app, with the appropriate key information persisting within the associated lock. If an attacker acquires one of these keys, they can utilize it to unlock the lock after its intended deletion or invalidation. </p>
<p>•   CVE-2023-7004</p>
<p>The TTLock App does not employ proper verification procedures to ensure that it is communicating with the expected device. This can be utilized by a threat actor who introduces a device that spoofs the MAC address of the lock, allowing for compromise of the unlockKey value.</p>
<p>•   CVE-2023-7007</p>
<p>The Sciener server does not validate connection requests from the GatewayG2, allowing an impersonation attack. An attacker can impersonate the MAC address of a GatewayG2 that has established a connection with a lock, then connect to Sciener servers and receive messages instead of the legitimate GatewayG2. This can facilitate access of the unlockKey character. </p>
<p>•   CVE-2023-7009</p>
<p>The Kontrol Lux lock supports plaintext message processing over Bluetooth Low Energy, allowing unencrypted malicious commands to be passed to the lock. These malicious commands, less then 16 bytes in length, will be processed by the lock as if they were encrypted communications. This can be further exploited by an attacker to compromise the locks integrity. </p>
<p>•   CVE-2023-7017</p>
<p>The Kontrol Lux lock firmware update mechanism does not authenticate or validate firmware updates if passed to the lock through the Bluetooth Low Energy service. A challenge request can be sent to the lock with a command to prepare for an update, rather than an unlock request. This allows an attacker within Bluetooth range to pass an arbitrary malicious firmware to the lock, compromising its integrity. </p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>These vulnerabilities allow attackers with physical, adjacent, or Bluetooth connection proximity to the lock access of various capabilities to compromise the lock integrity, without victim knowledge or interaction. This results in the locks functionality being null. </p>
<p>Affected versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kontrol Lux lock, firmware versions 6.5.x to 6.5.07</li>
<li>Gateway G2, firmware version 6.0.0</li>
<li>TTLock App, version 6.4.5</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>There is no software solution for these vulnerabilities, only a potential work-around. By disabling various functions related to the Bluetooth capability of locks using Sciener firmware, several of the attacks can be prevented. However, as the locks are designed with the intention of utilization with the TTLock App, this may not be a practical solution for most users.</p>

CVE-2024-27198 JetBrains TeamCity Authentication Bypass Vulnerability

CISA urges organizations to review the following JetBrains blog post and apply the necessary updates: Additional Critical Security Issues Affecting TeamCity On-Premises (CVE-2024-27198 and CVE-2024-27199) – Update to 2023.11.4 Now.
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-51782)

Alon Zahavi discovered that the NVMe-oF/TCP subsystem of the Linux kernel
did not properly handle connect command payloads in certain situations,
leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. A remote attacker could use
this to expose sensitive information (kernel memory). (CVE-2023-6121)

Jann Horn discovered that the io_uring subsystem in the Linux kernel
contained an out-of-bounds access vulnerability. A local attacker could use
this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2023-6560)

Dan Carpenter discovered that the netfilter subsystem in the Linux kernel
did not store data in properly sized memory locations. A local user could
use this to cause a denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2024-0607)

Supraja Sridhara, Benedict Schlüter, Mark Kuhne, Andrin Bertschi, and
Shweta Shinde discovered that the Confidential Computing framework in the
Linux kernel for x86 platforms did not properly handle 32-bit emulation on
TDX and SEV. An attacker with access to the VMM could use this to cause a
denial of service (guest crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2024-23225 Apple iOS and iPadOS Memory Corruption Vulnerability
CVE-2024-23296 Apple iOS and iPadOS Memory Corruption Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[USN-6649-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The update introduced
several minor regressions. This update fixes the problem.

Original advisory details:

 Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were
 tricked into opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
 potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive
 information across domains, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2024-1547,
 CVE-2024-1548, CVE-2024-1549, CVE-2024-1550, CVE-2024-1553, CVE-2024-1554,
 CVE-2024-1555, CVE-2024-1557)
 
 Alfred Peters discovered that Firefox did not properly manage memory when
 storing and re-accessing data on a networking channel. An attacker could
 potentially exploit this issue to cause a denial of service.
 (CVE-2024-1546)
 
 Johan Carlsson discovered that Firefox incorrectly handled Set-Cookie
 response headers in multipart HTTP responses. An attacker could
 potentially exploit this issue to inject arbitrary cookie values.
 (CVE-2024-1551)
 
 Gary Kwong discovered that Firefox incorrectly generated codes on 32-bit
 ARM devices, which could lead to unexpected numeric conversions or
 undefined behaviour. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a
 denial of service. (CVE-2024-1552)
 
 Ronald Crane discovered that Firefox did not properly manage memory when
 accessing the built-in profiler. An attacker could potentially exploit
 this issue to cause a denial of service. (CVE-2024-1556)]]></summary>

CVE-2023-21237 Android Pixel Information Disclosure Vulnerability
CVE-2021-36380 Sunhillo SureLine OS Command Injection Vulnerablity
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

CVE-2024-21338 Microsoft Windows Kernel Exposed IOCTL with Insufficient Access Control Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

CVE-2023-29360 Microsoft Streaming Service Untrusted Pointer Dereference Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

University cybersecurity clinics train students from diverse backgrounds and academic expertise to strengthen the digital defenses of non-profits, hospitals, municipalities, small businesses, and other under-resourced organizations. They can help address the national cyber workforce gap by developing a talent pipeline for cyber civil defense and helping students see themselves in a cybersecurity career.
CISA encourages clinics to engage with CISA and leverage the CISA resources outlined in the guide. CISA also encourages more universities to consider starting their own cybersecurity clinics as they play an important role in strengthening the cybersecurity posture of small organizations at the local level.]]></summary>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of detail in the Apple <a href="https://security.apple.com/blog/imessage-pq3/">blog post</a>, and more in Douglas Stabila&#8217;s <a href="https://security.apple.com/assets/files/Security_analysis_of_the_iMessage_PQ3_protocol_Stebila.pdf">security analysis</a>.</p>
<p>I am of two minds about this. On the one hand, it&#8217;s probably premature to switch to any particular post-quantum algorithms. The mathematics of cryptanalysis for these lattice and other systems is still rapidly evolving, and we&#8217;re likely to break more of them&#8212;and learn a lot in the process&#8212;over the coming few years. But if you&#8217;re going to make the switch, this is an excellent choice. And Apple&#8217;s ability to do this so efficiently speaks well about its algorithmic agility, which is probably more important than its particular cryptographic design. And it is probably about the right time to worry about, and defend against, attackers who are storing encrypted messages in hopes of breaking them later on future quantum computers...</p>]]></summary>

<blockquote><p>LLM Agents can Autonomously Hack Websites</p>
<p><b>Abstract:</b> In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly capable and can now interact with tools (i.e., call functions), read documents, and recursively call themselves. As a result, these LLMs can now function autonomously as agents. With the rise in capabilities of these agents, recent work has speculated on how LLM agents would affect cybersecurity. However, not much is known about the offensive capabilities of LLM agents.</p>
<p>In this work, we show that LLM agents can autonomously hack websites, performing tasks as complex as blind database schema extraction and SQL injections without human feedback. Importantly, the agent does not need to know the vulnerability beforehand. This capability is uniquely enabled by frontier models that are highly capable of tool use and leveraging extended context. Namely, we show that GPT-4 is capable of such hacks, but existing open-source models are not. Finally, we show that GPT-4 is capable of autonomously finding vulnerabilities in websites in the wild. Our findings raise questions about the widespread deployment of LLMs...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>
