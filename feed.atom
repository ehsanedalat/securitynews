        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: September 23, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA has added one new vulnerability to it's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.      
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

Summary
Traditional approaches to securing OT/ICS do not adequately address current threats. 
Operational technology/industrial control system (OT/ICS) assets that operate, control, and monitor day-to-day critical infrastructure and industrial processes continue to be an attractive target for malicious cyber actors. These cyber actors, including advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, target OT/ICS assets to achieve political gains, economic advantages, or destructive effects. Because OT/ICS systems manage physical operational processes, cyber actors’ operations could result in physical consequences, including loss of life, property damage, and disruption of National Critical Functions.
OT/ICS devices and designs are publicly available, often inco…]]></summary>

<p>Here&#8217;s the problem: You can&#8217;t see the false start. Nobody can see the false start. By sight, Allen most definitely does not leave before the gun.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the thing: World Athletics has determined that it is not possible for someone to push off the block within a tenth of a second of the gun without false starting. They have science that shows it is beyond human capabilities to react that fast. Of course there are those (I&#8217;m among them) who would tell you that&#8217;s nonsense, that&#8217;s pseudoscience, there&#8217;s no way that they can limit human capabilities like that. There is science that shows it is humanly impossible to hit a fastball. There was once science that showed human beings could not run a four-minute mile...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

to include binary packages for some architectures. This update fixes that
regression.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing bounds checks
 when executing spell suggestion commands. An attacker could possibly use
 this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.
 (CVE-2022-0943)
 
 It was discovered that Vim was using freed memory when dealing with
 regular expressions through its old regular expression engine. If a user
 were tricked into opening a specially crafted file, an attacker could
 crash the application, leading to a denial of service, or possibly achieve
 code execution. (CVE-2022-1154)
 
 It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing checks on name of
 lambda functions. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a
 denial of service. This issue affected only Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.
 (CVE-2022-1420)
 
 It was discovered that Vim was incorrectly performing bounds checks
 when processing invalid commands with composing characters in Ex
 mode. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of
 service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1616)
 
 It was discovered that Vim was not properly processing latin1 data
 when issuing Ex commands. An attacker could possibly use this issue to
 cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1619)
 
 It was discovered that Vim was not properly performing memory
 management when dealing with invalid regular expression patterns in
 buffers. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of
 service. (CVE-2022-1620)
 
 It was discovered that Vim was not properly processing invalid bytes
 when performing spell check operations. An attacker could possibly use
 this issue to cause a denial of service or execute arbitrary code.

This is done without a warrant, because &#8220;&#8230;courts have long granted an exception to border authorities, allowing them to search people&#8217;s devices without a warrant or suspicion of a crime.&#8221;</p>
<blockquote><p>CBP&#8217;s inspection of people&#8217;s phones, laptops, tablets and other electronic devices as they enter the country has long been a controversial practice that the agency has defended as a low-impact way to pursue possible security threats and determine an individual&#8217;s &#8220;intentions upon entry&#8221; into the U.S. But the revelation that thousands of agents have access to a searchable database without public oversight is a new development in what privacy advocates and some lawmakers warn could be an infringement of Americans&#8217; Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-09-15T16:41:05.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: September 15, 2022
CISA has added six new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.  
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

One thief stands near you while you&#8217;re in the grocery store, intercepting your key&#8217;s transmitted signal with a radio transceiver. Another stands near your car, with another transceiver, taking the signal from their friend and passing it on to the car. Since the car and the key can now talk, through the thieves&#8217; range extenders, the car has no reason to suspect the key isn&#8217;t inside&#8212;and fires right up...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

CISA and the National Security Agency (NSA) have published Open Radio Access Network Security Considerations. This product—generated by the Enduring Security Framework (ESF) Open Radio Access Network (RAN) Working Panel, a subgroup within the cross-sector working group—assessed the benefits and security considerations associated with implementing an Open RAN architecture. Focusing on current designs and specification standards, the ESF Open RAN Working Panel examined how security compares with, and is distinct from, traditional, proprietary RANs.
CISA encourages users, network operators, vendors, and stakeholders to review the considerations. For more information, see the ESF’s Open Radio Access Network Security Considerations, peruse CISA’s 5G Library, and visit Securing 5G Open RAN Architecture from Cybersecurity Risks.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: September 14, 2022
CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the “Date Added to Catalog” column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

This advisory updates previous joint reporting from November 2021, to highlight continued malicious cyber activity by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors that the authoring agencies now assess are associated with the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
The authoring agencies urge network defenders to examine their current cybersecurity posture and apply the recommended mitigations in this joint CSA, which include:
Patch all systems and prioritize remediating known exploited vulnerabilities.
Enforce multifactor authentication (MFA).
Secure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and other risky services.
Make offline backups of your data.
See Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Affiliated Cyber Actors Exploiting Vulnerabilities for Data Extortion and Disk Encryption for Ransom Operations and joint CSA Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities for information on these Iranian government-sponsored APT actors’ tactics and techniques, indicators of compromise, and recommended mitigations. Additionally, review StopRansomware.gov for more guidance on ransomware protection, detection, and response.

<blockquote><p>Why can’t the cryptocurrency industry solve the problem the way the software and hardware industries do, by patching and updating security as flaws are found? Two reasons: First, many customers don’t have an ongoing relationship with the hardware and software providers that protect their funds­&#8212;nor do they have an incentive to update security on a regular basis. Turning to a new security provider or using updated software creates risks; leaving everything the way it was feels safer. So users won’t be rushing to pay for and install new security patches...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-09-08T12:25:32.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: September 8, 2022
CISA has added twelve new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.
