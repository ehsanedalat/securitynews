        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2023-41265 Qlik Sense HTTP Tunneling Vulnerability
CVE-2023-41266 Qlik Sense Path Traversal Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)—in coordination with the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (UK-NCSC), Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ASD’s ACSC), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC-NZ), and the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Cyber Command Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF)—released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) Russian FSB Cyber Actor Star Blizzard Continues Worldwide Spear-phishing Campaigns. The joint CSA aims to raise awareness of the specific tactics, techniques, and delivery methods used by this Russia-based threat actor group to target individuals and organizations. Known Star Blizzard techniques include:
Impersonating known contacts' email accounts,
Creating fake social media profiles,
Using webmail addresses from providers such as Outlook, Gmail and others, and
Creating malicious domains that resemble legitimate organizations.
CISA encourages network defenders and critical infrastructure organizations review the CSA to improve their cybersecurity posture and protect against similar exploitation based on threat actor activity. CISA also urges software manufacturers to incorporate secure-by-design and -default principles into their software development practices, limiting the impact of threat actor activity.
For more guidance to protect against the most common and impactful threats, visit CISA’s Cross-Sector Cybersecurity Performance Goals. For more information on secure by design, see CISA’s Secure by Design webpage.]]></summary>

        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/811862"/>
        <updated>2023-12-06T18:59:53.288Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Implementation of Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) by Vendors provide a way to customize logo image displayed during the early boot phase. Binarly has uncovered vulnerabilities in the image parsing libraries that provide this capability. An attacker with local privileged access can exploit these vulnerability to modify UEFI settings. </p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>UEFI firmware provides an extensible interface between an operating system and hardware platform. UEFI software stores a number of settings and files in a customized Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI)  partition known as EFI system partition (ESP).  ESP is a special privileged file system that is independent of the OS and essentially acts as the storage place for the UEFI boot loaders, applications, hardware drivers and customizable settings to be launched by the UEFI firmware. The ESP partition is mandatory for UEFI boot and is protected from unprivileged access.  The information stored in ESP is probed and processed during <a href="https://insights.sei.cmu.edu/media/images/figure3_08012022.max-1280x720.format-webp.webp"> the early phases of an UEFI based OS</a>.  One such information stored in the ESP is a personalizable  boot logo. </p>
<p>Binarly has discovered a number of vulnerabilities in the image parsing libraries that read and process these image files. As these files are processed by executables that run under a high privilege, it is possible to exploit these vulnerabilities in order to access and modify high-privileged UEFI settings of a device. UEFI supply-chain allows for many of these shared libraries to be integrated in various ways, including compiled from source, licensed for modification and reuse and finally as a dynamic or static linked executable. Binarly has also observed that in some cases an attacker can create a bundled firmware update that contains a corrupt or malicious image to trigger these vulnerabilities.  This can also allow an attacker to exploit vulnerability while flashing the PCI with a firmware update.  Due to the complex nature of these vulnerabilities and their potential wide impact, Binarly would like to use the label <code>LogoFAIL</code> to track and support coordination and mitigation of these vulnerabilities.  </p>
<p>Note: Multiple CVE's may be applied to these set of vulnerabilities due to many implementations and potential customization of the libraries and sources that introduce these weaknesses. Please check the Vendor Information section for details provided by various vendors for mitigation and fixes.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The impacts of these vulnerabilities vary widely due to the nature of the UEFI software and various implementations through the supply-chain. </p>
<p>In summary, a local attacker with administrative privileges to the ESP partition or to the firmware flash can use malicious images to perform any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disable UEFI security features (SecureBoot)</li>
<li>Modify the UEFI Boot Order or the designated Boot Partition</li>
<li>Execute unwanted software to infect protected Operating System</li>
</ul>
<p>In some cases, attacker can use the vendor provided logo customization interface to upload these malicious images.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p><strong>Apply Updates</strong></p>
<p>Multiple vendors from the supply-chain have provided their solution to these vulnerabilities and have provided software updates to address them.  Please verify your vendor provided Statement and their solution below with any reference or additional information to address this issue.</p>
<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>Thanks to Binarly for reporting these vulnerabilities. We would also like to thank multiple vendors from the UEFI supply-chain cooperated to address these issues</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, as part of the Secure by Design campaign, CISA published The Case for Memory Safe Roadmaps: Why Both C-Suite Executives and Technical Experts Need to Take Memory Safe Coding Seriously in collaboration with the following partners:
United States National Security Agency
United States Federal Bureau of Investigation
Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre
Canadian Centre for Cyber Security
United Kingdom National Cyber Security Centre
New Zealand National Cyber Security Centre
Computer Emergency Response Team New Zealand
Malicious cyber actors routinely exploit memory safety vulnerabilities, which are common coding errors and the most prevalent type of disclosed software vulnerability. Preventing and responding to these vulnerabilities cost both software manufacturers and their customer organizations significant time and resources.
The Case for Memory Safe Roadmaps details how software manufacturers can transition to memory safe programming languages (MSLs) to eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities. The guidance provides manufacturers steps for creating and publishing memory safe roadmaps that will show their customers how they are owning security outcomes, embracing radical transparency, and taking a top-down approach to developing secure products—key Secure by Design tenets.
CISA and our partners urge C-suite and technical experts at software manufacturers to read this guidance and implement memory safe roadmaps to eliminate memory safety vulnerabilities from their product.

If I hired a private detective to spy on you, that detective could hide a bug in your home or car, tap your phone, and listen to what you said. At the end, I would get a report of all the conversations you had and the contents of those conversations. If I hired that same private detective to put you under surveillance, I would get a different report: where you went, whom you talked to, what you purchased, what you did.</p>
<p>Before the internet, putting someone under surveillance was expensive and time-consuming. You had to manually follow someone around, noting where they went, whom they talked to, what they purchased, what they did, and what they read. That world is forever gone. Our phones track our locations. Credit cards track our purchases. Apps track whom we talk to, and e-readers know what we read. Computers collect data about what we&#8217;re doing on them, and as both storage and processing have become cheaper, that data is increasingly saved and used.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added four new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2023-33106 Qualcomm Multiple Chipsets Use of Out-of-Range Pointer Offset Vulnerability
CVE-2023-33063 Qualcomm Multiple Chipsets Use-After-Free Vulnerability
CVE-2023-33107 Qualcomm Multiple Chipsets Integer Overflow Vulnerability
CVE-2022-22071 Qualcomm Multiple Chipsets Use-After-Free Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2023-42917 Apple Multiple Products WebKit Memory Corruption Vulnerability
CVE-2023-42916 Apple Multiple Products WebKit Out-of-Bounds Read Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

IRGC-affiliated cyber actors using the persona “CyberAv3ngers” are actively targeting and compromising Israeli-made Unitronics Vision Series PLCs that are publicly exposed to the internet, through the use of default passwords. The PLCs may be rebranded and appear as different manufacturers and company names. 
All organizations, including U.S. Water and Wastewater Systems Facilities, are encouraged to review this joint CSA and implement the recommended actions and mitigations. The mitigations are based on threat actor activity against Unitronics PLCs but apply to all internet-facing PLCs.]]></summary>

CVE-2022-28958 DIR-816L Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

In summary, the vulnerabilities allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to access sensitive documents by manipulating identifiers and file names in URLs. CISA understands that some of the vulnerabilities may have been mitigated. Further information is available in the researcher’s disclosure and a corresponding article.
CISA encourages users and administrators to apply security updates as they become available for the following vulnerabilities:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2023-6345 Google Skia Integer Overflow Vulnerability
CVE-2023-49103 ownCloud graphapi Information Disclosure Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

These are just three laptop models from the wide universe of PCs, but one of these three companies usually does make the fingerprint sensor in every laptop we&#8217;ve reviewed in the last few years.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, in a landmark collaboration, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the UK National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) are proud to announce the release of the Guidelines for Secure AI System Development. Co-sealed by 23 domestic and international cybersecurity organizations, this publication marks a significant step in addressing the intersection of artificial intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, and critical infrastructure.
The Guidelines, complementing the U.S. Voluntary Commitments on Ensuring Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy AI, provide essential recommendations for AI system development and emphasize the importance of adhering to Secure by Design principles. The approach prioritizes ownership of security outcomes for customers, embraces radical transparency and accountability, and establishes organizational structures where secure design is a top priority.
The Guidelines apply to all types of AI systems, not just frontier models. We provide suggestions and mitigations that will help data scientists, developers, managers, decision-makers, and risk owners make informed decisions about the secure design, model development, system development, deployment, and operation of their machine learning AI systems.
This document is aimed primarily at providers of AI systems, whether based on models hosted by an organization or making use of external application programming interfaces. However, we urge all stakeholders—including data scientists, developers, managers, decision-makers, and risk owners make—to read this guidance to help them make informed decisions about the design, deployment, and operation of their machine learning AI systems.
CISA invites stakeholders, partners, and the public to explore the Guidelines for Secure AI System Development as well as our recently published Roadmap for AI to learn more about our strategic vision for AI technology and cybersecurity. To access learn more, visit CISA.gov/AI.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Multi-State Information Sharing & Analysis Center (MS-ISAC), and Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Center (ASD’s ACSC) released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), #StopRansomware: LockBit Ransomware Affiliates Exploit CVE 2023-4966 Citrix Bleed Vulnerability (along with an accompanying analysis report MAR-10478915-1.v1 Citrix Bleed), in response to LockBit 3.0 ransomware affiliates and multiple threat actor groups exploiting CVE-2023-4966. Labeled Citrix Bleed, the vulnerability affects Citrix’s NetScaler web application delivery control (ADC) and NetScaler Gateway appliances.
Historically, LockBit affiliates have conducted attacks against organizations of varying sizes across multiple critical infrastructure sectors—including education, energy, financial services, food and agriculture, government and emergency services, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation. The joint CSA provides tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), as well as indicators of compromise (IOCs).
If compromise is detected, the authoring organizations encourage network defenders hunt for malicious activity on their networks using the detection methods and IOCs provided within the CSA and apply the incident response recommendations. Additionally, immediate application of publicly available patches is also recommended. For more information, visit StopRansomware and see the updated #StopRansomware Guide.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2023-4911 GNU C Library Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>
