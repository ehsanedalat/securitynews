CISA received three files for analysis. The files included three webshells written in PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor (PHP), Active Server Pages Extended (ASPX), and .NET Dynamic-Link Library (DLL). The sample “sd.php” is highly obfuscated and uses rot13 algorithm, zlib for compression and base64 encoding for obfuscation. The “osker.aspx” webshell code was padded with junk code. The .NET DLL webshell is a .NET compiled version of osker.aspx. The samples are interactive webshells and have the ability to upload and manage files, create directories and files, and execute commands on the target machine.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) is releasing this Cybersecurity Advisory to warn network defenders about exploitation of CVE-2023-3519, an unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability affecting NetScaler (formerly Citrix) Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and NetScaler Gateway. In June 2023, threat actors exploited this vulnerability as a zero-day to drop a webshell on a critical infrastructure organization’s non-production environment NetScaler ADC appliance. The webshell enabled the actors to perform …]]></summary>

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) identified the presence of indicators of compromise (IOCs) at an Aeronautical Sector organization as early as January 2023. Analysts confirmed that nation-state advanced persistent threat (APT) actors exploited CVE-2022-47966 to gain unauthorized access to a public-facing application (Zoho ManageEngine ServiceDesk Plus), establish persistence, and move laterally through the network. This vulnerability allows for remote code execution on the ManageEngine application. Additional APT actors were also observed exploiting CVE-2022-42475 to establish presence on the organization’s firewall device.

The Australian Signals Directorate’s Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory to warn vendors, designers, and developers of web applications and organizations using web applications about insecure direct object reference (IDOR) vulnerabilities. IDOR vulnerabilities are access control vulnerabilities enabling malicious actors to modify or delete data or access sensitive data by issuing requests to a website or a web application programming interface (API) specifying the user identifier of other, valid users. These requests succeed where there is a failure to perform adequate authentication and authorization checks.

The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to disseminate QakBot infrastructure indicators of compromise (IOCs) identified through FBI investigations as of August 2023. On August 25, FBI and international partners executed a coordinated operation to disrupt QakBot infrastructure worldwide. Disruption operations targeting QakBot infrastructure resulted in the botnet takeover, which severed the connection between victim computers and QakBot command and control (C2) servers. The FBI is working closely with industry partners to share information about the malware to maximize detection, remediation, and prevention measures for network defenders.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2018-14667 Red Hat JBoss RichFaces Framework Expression Language Injection Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), along with the Japan National Police Agency (NPA) and the Japan National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) released joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) People's Republic of China-Linked Cyber Actors Hide in Router Firmware. The CSA details activity by cyber actors, known as BlackTech, linked to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). The advisory provides BlackTech tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and urges multinational corporations to review all subsidiary connections, verify access, and consider implementing zero trust models to limit the extent of a potential BlackTech compromise.
BlackTech has demonstrated capabilities in modifying router firmware without detection and exploiting routers’ domain-trust relationships to pivot from international subsidiaries to headquarters in Japan and the United States, which are the primary targets.
CISA strongly recommends organizations review the advisory and implement the detection and mitigation techniques described to protect devices and networks. For additional guidance, see People’s Republic of China State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Exploit Network Providers and Devices and visit CISA’s China Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories page.]]></summary>

<blockquote><p>On Thursday, researchers from security firm Rezillion published evidence that they said made it &#8220;highly likely&#8221; both indeed stemmed from the same bug, specifically in libwebp, the code library that apps, operating systems, and other code libraries incorporate to process WebP images.</p>
<p>Rather than Apple, Google, and Citizen Lab coordinating and accurately reporting the common origin of the vulnerability, they chose to use a separate CVE designation, the researchers said. The researchers concluded that &#8220;millions of different applications&#8221; would remain vulnerable until they, too, incorporated the libwebp fix. That, in turn, they said, was preventing automated systems that developers use to track known vulnerabilities in their offerings from detecting a critical vulnerability that&#8217;s under active exploitation...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

CVE-2023-41992 Apple Multiple Products Kernel Privilege Escalation Vulnerability
CVE-2023-41993 Apple Multiple Products WebKit Code Execution Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

CVE-2023-41179 Trend Micro Apex One and Worry-Free Business Security Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

        <id>https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/347067</id>
        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/347067"/>
        <updated>2023-09-12T16:36:11.380Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Multiple BGP implementations have been identified as vulnerable to specially crafted Path Attributes of a BGP UPDATE. Instead of ignoring invalid updates they reset the underlying TCP connection for the BGP session and de-peer the router. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is undesirable because a session reset impacts not only routes with the BGP UPDATE but also the other valid routes exchanged over the session. <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7606#section-1">RFC 7606 Introduction</a> </p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4271">RFC 4271</a>) is a widely used inter-Autonomous System routing protocol. BGP communication among peer routers is critical to the stable operation of the Internet. A number of known BGP security issues were addressed in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7606">RFC 7606</a> <em>Revised Error Handling for BGP UPDATE Messages</em> in 2015. </p>
<p>Recent reports indicate that multiple BGP implementations do not properly handle specially crafted Path Attributes in the BGP UPDATE messages. An attacker with a valid, configured BGP session could inject a specially crafted packet into an existing BGP session or the underlying TCP session (179/tcp). A vulnerable BGP implementation could drop sessions when processing crafted UPDATE messages. A persistent attack could lead to routing instability (route flapping).</p>
<p>This vulnerability was first announced as affecting <a href="https://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/patches/7.3/common/006_bgpd.patch.sig">OpenBSD</a> based routers. Further investigation indicates that other vendors are affected by the same or similar issues. Please see the <a href="#systems">Systems Affected</a> section below.
Here are the CVE IDs that were reserved by the reporter for different vendors that were tested:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-4481">CVE-2023-4481</a> (Juniper)</li>
<li><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38802">CVE-2023-38802</a> (FRR)</li>
<li><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-38283">CVE-2023-38283</a> (OpenBGPd)</li>
<li><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-40457">CVE-2023-40457</a> (EXOS)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>A remote attacker could publish a BGP UPDATE with a crafted set of Path Attributes, causing vulnerable routers to de-peer from any link from which such an update were received. Unaffected routers might also pass the crafted updates across the network, potentially leading to the update arriving at an affected router from multiple sources, causing multiple links to fail.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>The CERT/CC is currently unaware of a practical solutions for every vendor but some of the vendors allow you to change the response to errors in BGP path updates. Networks using appliances from Juniper and Nokia can mitigate this behavior by enabling:</p>
<p><strong>(Juniper)</strong><br>
set protocols bgp bgp-error-tolerance</p>
<p><strong>(Nokia)</strong><br>
[router bgp group]<br>
error-handling update-fault-tolerance</p>

canonical_ltd. -- snapd_for_linux
Using the TIOCLINUX ioctl request, a malicious snap could inject contents into the input of the controlling terminal which could allow it to cause arbitrary commands to be executed outside of the snap sandbox after the snap exits. Graphical terminal emulators like xterm, gnome-terminal and others are not affected - this can only be exploited when snaps are run on a virtual console.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the N300 Wireless N VDSL2 Modem Router manufactured by Tenda. This vulnerability allows a remote, unauthenticated user to access sensitive information.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p><a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-4498">CVE-2023-4498</a> is an authentication bypass vulnerability that enables an unauthenticated attacker who has access to the web console, either locally or remotely, to access resources that would normally be protected. The attacker can  construct a web request that includes a white-listed keyword in the path, causing the URL to be served directly (rather than blocked or challenged with an authentication prompt).</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could grant the attacker access to pages that would otherwise require authentication. An unauthenticated attacker could thereby gain access to sensitive information, such as the Administrative password, which could be used to launch additional attacks.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>There is no known solution to the vulnerability.  Always update your router to the latest available firmware version. Disabling both the remote (WAN-side) administration services and the web interface on the WAN on any SoHo router is also recommended.</p>
<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>Thanks to the reporter from the Spike Reply Cybersecurity Team. This document was written by Timur Snoke.</p>]]></summary>
