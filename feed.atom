<blockquote><p>Section 1 of this paper sets the stage by briefly describing the problem to be solved. Section 2 canvasses the different fields of law (warranty, negligence, products liability, and certification) that could provide a starting point for what would have to be legislative action establishing a system of software liability. The conclusion is that all of these fields would face the same question: How buggy is too buggy? Section 3 explains why existing software development frameworks do not provide a sufficiently definitive basis for legal liability. They focus on process, while a liability regime should begin with a focus on the product&#8212;­that is, on outcomes. Expanding on the idea of building codes for building code, Section 4 shows some examples of product-focused standards from other fields. Section 5 notes that already there have been definitive expressions of software defects that can be drawn together to form the minimum legal standard of security. It specifically calls out the list of common software weaknesses tracked by the MITRE Corporation under a government contract.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Humans are capable of strategically deceptive behavior: behaving helpfully in most situations, but then behaving very differently in order to pursue alternative objectives when given the opportunity. If an AI system learned such a deceptive strategy, could we detect it and remove it using current state-of-the-art safety training techniques? To study this question, we construct proof-of-concept examples of deceptive behavior in large language models (LLMs). For example, we train models that write secure code when the prompt states that the year is 2023, but insert exploitable code when the stated year is 2024. We find that such backdoor behavior can be made persistent, so that it is not removed by standard safety training techniques, including supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training (eliciting unsafe behavior and then training to remove it). The backdoor behavior is most persistent in the largest models and in models trained to produce chain-of-thought reasoning about deceiving the training process, with the persistence remaining even when the chain-of-thought is distilled away. Furthermore, rather than removing backdoors, we find that adversarial training can teach models to better recognize their backdoor triggers, effectively hiding the unsafe behavior. Our results suggest that, once a model exhibits deceptive behavior, standard techniques could fail to remove such deception and create a false impression of safety...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

The rules put control of that data back in the hands of ordinary Americans, while at the same time undermining the data broker economy and increasing customer choice and competition. Beyond these economic effects, the rules have important data security benefits.</p>
<p>The CFPB&#8217;s rules align with a key security idea: the <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/data-privacy">decoupling principle</a>. By separating which companies see what parts of our data, and in what contexts, we can gain control over data about ourselves (improving privacy) and harden cloud infrastructure against hacks (improving security). Officials at the CFPB have described the new rules as an attempt to accelerate a shift toward &#8220;open banking,&#8221; and after an initial comment period on the new rules closed late last year, Rohit Chopra, the CFPB&#8217;s director, ...</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) published guidance on Security Design Improvements for SOHO Device Manufacturers as a part of the new Secure by Design (SbD) Alert series that focuses on how manufacturers should shift the burden of security away from customers by integrating security into product design and development.
This third publication in CISA’s SbD Alert series examines how manufacturers can eliminate the path threat actors—particularly the People’s Republic of China (PRC)-sponsored Volt Typhoon group—are taking to compromise small office/home office (SOHO) routers. Specifically, CISA and FBI urge manufacturers to:
Eliminate exploitable defects—during the product design and development phases—in SOHO router web management interfaces (WMIs).
Adjust default device configurations in a way that:

Automates update capabilities.
Locates the WMI on LAN side ports.
Requires a manual override to remove security settings.


CISA and FBI also urge manufacturers to protect against Volt Typhoon activity and other cyber threats by disclosing vulnerabilities via the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) program as well as by supplying accurate Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) classification for these vulnerabilities. The Alert also urges manufacturers to implement incentive structures that prioritize security during product design and development.
CISA and FBI urge SOHO device manufacturers to read and implement Security Design Improvements for SOHO Device Manufacturers, which aligns to principles one through three of the joint guidance, Shifting the Balance of Cybersecurity Risk: Principles and Approaches for Secure by Design Software:
Take ownership of customer security outcomes.
Embrace Radical Transparency and Accountability.
Build organizational structure and leadership to achieve these goals.
By implementing these principles in their design, development, and delivery processes, manufactures can prevent exploitation of SOHO routers. To learn more, visit Secure by Design.]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-01-30T12:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA is releasing this alert to provide cyber defenders with new mitigations to defend against threat actors exploiting Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure Gateways vulnerabilities in Ivanti devices (CVE-2023-46805 and CVE-2024-21887).  
Threat actors are continuing to leverage vulnerabilities in Ivanti Connect Secure and Policy Secure Gateways to capture credentials and/or drop webshells that enable further compromise of enterprise networks. Some threat actors have recently developed workarounds to current mitigations and detection methods and have been able to exploit weaknesses, move laterally, and escalate privileges without detection. CISA is aware of instances in which sophisticated threat actors have subverted the external integrity checker tool (ICT), further minimizing traces of their intrusion.  
If an organization has been running Ivanti Connect Secure (9.x and 22.x) and Policy Secure gateways over the last several weeks and/or continues to run these products, CISA recommends continuous threat hunting on any systems connected to—or recently connected to—the Ivanti device. Additionally, organizations should monitor authentication, account usage, and identity management services that could be exposed and isolate the system(s) from any enterprise resources as much as possible.  
After applying patches, when these become available, CISA recommends that organizations continue to hunt their network in order to detect any compromise that may have occurred before patches were implemented.  
This guidance supplements CISA’s previous guidance for mitigation and detection, which remains applicable. For previous guidance, see CISA Issues Emergency Directive on Ivanti Vulnerabilities and Ivanti Releases Security Update for Connect Secure and Policy Secure Gateways.]]></summary>

In their earliest years, computers required carefully constructed instructions, delivered through punch cards; then came a command-line interface, followed by menus and options and text boxes. If you wanted results, you needed to learn the computer&#8217;s language.</p>
<p>This is beginning to change. Large language models&#8212;the technology undergirding modern chatbots&#8212;allow users to interact with computers through natural conversation, an innovation that introduces some baggage from human-to-human exchanges. Early on in our respective explorations of ChatGPT, the two of us found ourselves typing a word that we&#8217;d never said to a computer before: &#8220;Please.&#8221; The syntax of civility has crept into nearly every aspect of our encounters; we speak to this algebraic assemblage as if it were a person&#8212;even when we know that ...</p>]]></summary>

CISA’s community-driven working groups publish documents and reports to advance and refine SBOM and ultimately promote adoption. Specifically, software producers often need to assemble and test products together before releasing them to customers. These products may contain components that experience version changes over time, therefore creating a need to be tracked. This document serves as a guide for creating the build for SBOM assembled products.

Oleksenko discovered that some AMD processors could leak stale data from
division operations in certain situations. A local attacker could possibly
use this to expose sensitive information. (CVE-2023-20588)

It was discovered that a race condition existed in the Linux kernel when
performing operations with kernel objects, leading to an out-of-bounds
write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system
crash) or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-45863)

It was discovered that the CIFS network file system implementation in the
Linux kernel did not properly validate the server frame size in certain
situation, leading to an out-of-bounds read vulnerability. An attacker
could use this to construct a malicious CIFS image that, when operated on,
could cause a denial of service (system crash) or possibly expose sensitive
information. (CVE-2023-6606)

Budimir Markovic, Lucas De Marchi, and Pengfei Xu discovered that the perf
subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly validate all event sizes
when attaching new events, leading to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)
or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6931)

It was discovered that the IGMP protocol implementation in the Linux kernel
contained a race condition, leading to a use-after-free vulnerability. A
local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service (system crash)
or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2023-6932)]]></summary>

<blockquote><p>The researchers first trained the AI models using supervised learning and then used additional &#8220;safety training&#8221; methods, including more supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and adversarial training. After this, they checked if the AI still had hidden behaviors. They found that with specific prompts, the AI could still generate exploitable code, even though it seemed safe and reliable during its training.</p>
<p>During stage 2, Anthropic applied reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning to the three models, stating that the year was 2023. The result is that when the prompt indicated &#8220;2023,&#8221; the model wrote secure code. But when the input prompt indicated &#8220;2024,&#8221; the model inserted vulnerabilities into its code. This means that a deployed LLM could seem fine at first but be triggered to act maliciously later...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

CVE-2023-22527 Atlassian Confluence Data Center and Server Template Injection Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
<p>We show that built-in sensors in commodity PCs, such as microphones, inadvertently capture electromagnetic side-channel leakage from ongoing computation. Moreover, this information is often conveyed by supposedly-benign channels such as audio recordings and common Voice-over-IP applications, even after lossy compression.</p>
<p>Thus, we show, it is possible to conduct physical side-channel attacks on computation by remote and purely passive analysis of commonly-shared channels. These attacks require neither physical proximity (which could be mitigated by distance and shielding), nor the ability to run code on the target or configure its hardware. Consequently, we argue, physical side channels on PCs can no longer be excluded from remote-attack threat models...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

CVE-2024-23222 Apple Multiple Products Type Confusion Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

argoproj -- argo-cd
Argo CD is a declarative, GitOps continuous delivery tool for Kubernetes. The Argo CD API prior to versions 2.10-rc2, 2.9.4, 2.8.8, and 2.7.15 are vulnerable to a cross-server request forgery (CSRF) attack when the attacker has the ability to write HTML to a page on the same parent domain as Argo CD. A CSRF attack works by tricking an authenticated Argo CD user into loading a web page which contains code to call Argo CD API endpoints on the victim's behalf. For example, an attacker could send an Argo CD user a link to a page which looks harmless but in the background calls an Argo CD API endpoint to create an application running malicious code. Argo CD uses the "Lax" SameSite cookie poli…]]></summary>

CVE-2023-34048 VMware vCenter Server Out-of-Bounds Write Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

At least, I think it is without my permission. It&#8217;s possible that I gave some sort of blanket permission when speaking at an event. It&#8217;s not likely, but it is possible.</p>
<p>I wrote to Zelle about it. Or, at least, I wrote to a company called <a href="https://www.earlywarning.com/">Early Warning</a> that owns Zelle about it. They asked me where the ads appeared. This seems odd to me. Podcast distribution networks drop ads in podcasts depending on the listener&#8212;like personalized ads on webpages&#8212;so the actual podcast doesn&#8217;t matter. And shouldn&#8217;t they know their own ads? Annoyingly, it seems time to get attorneys involved...</p>]]></summary>

CVE-2023-35082 Ivanti Endpoint Manager Mobile (EPMM) and MobileIron Core Authentication Bypass Vulnerability 
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, CISA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Environmental Protection Agency released a joint Incident Response Guide for the Water and Wastewater Systems (WWS) Sector. The guide includes contributions from over 25 WWS Sector organizations spanning private industry, nonprofit, and government entities. This coordination enabled CISA, FBI, and EPA to develop a guide with meaningful value to WWS Sector organizations.
Specifically, the guide provides information about the federal support available at each stage of the cyber incident response (IR) lifecycle and aims to enhance WWS Sector cybersecurity by:
    Establishing clear guidance for reporting cyber incidents;
    Connecting utilities with available cybersecurity resources, services, and no-cost trainings;
    Empowering utilities to build a strong cybersecurity baseline to improve cyber resilience and cyber hygiene; and
    Encouraging utilities to integrate into their local cyber communities.
CISA, FBI, and EPA urge all WWS Sector and critical infrastructure organizations to review this guidance and incorporate it into their organizational cyber incident response planning. Organizations can visit CISA.gov/water for additional sector tools, information, and resources.]]></summary>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> We conduct the first large-scale user study examining how users interact with an AI Code assistant to solve a variety of security related tasks across different programming languages. Overall, we find that participants who had access to an AI assistant based on OpenAI&#8217;s codex-davinci-002 model wrote significantly less secure code than those without access. Additionally, participants with access to an AI assistant were more likely to believe they wrote secure code than those without access to the AI assistant. Furthermore, we find that participants who trusted the AI less and engaged more with the language and format of their prompts (e.g. re-phrasing, adjusting temperature) provided code with fewer security vulnerabilities. Finally, in order to better inform the design of future AI-based Code assistants, we provide an in-depth analysis of participants&#8217; language and interaction behavior, as well as release our user interface as an instrument to conduct similar studies in the future...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <updated>2024-01-17T12:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added three new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2023-6549 Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway Buffer Overflow Vulnerability
CVE-2023-6548 Citrix NetScaler ADC and NetScaler Gateway Code Injection Vulnerability
CVE-2024-0519 Google Chromium V8 Out-of-Bounds Memory Access Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.
Please share your thoughts. We recently updated our anonymous Product Feedback Survey and we'd welcome your feedback.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>General-purpose graphics processing unit (GPGPU) platforms from AMD, Apple, and Qualcomm fail to adequately isolate process memory, thereby enabling a local attacker to read memory from other processes. An attacker with access to GPU capabilities using a vulnerable GPU's programmable interface can access memory that is expected to be isolated from other users and processes.  </p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Graphics processing units (GPUs), originally used to accelerate computer graphics, have today become the standard hardware accelerators for scientific computing and articifical intelligence / machine learning (AI/ML) applications due to their massive parallelism and high memory bandwidth. A GPGPU platform provides the ability to copy CPU memory to the GPU in order to perform these high-end computing tasks. The GPU kernel, essentially a user-provided C-like program that executes on the GPU, performs such intense numerical computations on the memory copied data. Afterwards, the CPU can copy the data back to present to the user or perform other tasds. This GPU-enabled high-performance computing is beneficial in many domains, including the training of artificial neural networks, doing inference on neural networks, and scientific computing. GPGPU platforms are useful in accelerating any task where operations such as matrix multiplication dominate the computation time. While GPGPUs are an essential part of large-scale ML implementations, such as Large Language Models (LLMs), they also serve a role as accelerators in client computing from applications to middleware. Standards, such as <a href="https://www.khronos.org/opencl/">OpenCL</a> (Open Computing Language) and Apple’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/metal/">Metal</a>, are frameworks that provide specifications for enabling such "close-to-metal" programming by giving applications direct access to these rich GPU computing capabilities on mobile devices and in high-performance computing datacenters.</p>
<p>Researchers at Trail of Bits have uncovered a vulnerability in which a GPU kernel can observe memory values from a different GPU kernel, even when these two kernels are isolated between applications, processes, or users. The specific region of memory that this behavior was observed is referred to as <code>local memory</code>, essentially this is a software-managed cache, similar to the L1 cache in CPUs. The size of this memory region can vary across GPUs from 10’s of KB to several MB. Trail of Bits have shown that this vulnerability can be observed through various programming interfaces, including Metal, Vulkan, and OpenCL, on various combinations of operating systems and drivers. Trail of Bits' research and testing, utilizing open-source software libraries, have identified platforms from AMD, Apple, and Qualcomm that exhibit this behavior. During the testing phase, this issue was not observed on NVIDIA devices. For further information review the information provided by Apple, AMD and Google in the <em>Vendor Information</em> section.</p>
<p>Researcher Tyler Sorenson, from Tail of Bits, states: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Due to the fact that most DNN computations (matrix multiplication and convolutions) make heavy use of local memory, the researchers also believe many ML implementations, both in the embedded domain as well as datacenter domain, may be impacted by this vulnerability.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The security researchers at Trail of Bits have labeled this vulnerability <code>LeftoverLocals</code> in order to identify this vulnerability when discussing across multiple GPU platforms.  </p>
<p>The GPU marketplace contains a wide and complex software supply-chain to facilitate the adoption of the advanced capabilities of GPUs. We expect that resolving these issues will require multiple stakeholders from hardware manufacturers, software library providers, programmers, system integrators standards bodies to cooperate. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2801153">Prior resaerch work in this area</a> has shown that resolving these issues may require a multi-pronged, ongoing-process approach.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker with access to a GPU programmable interface, like OpenCL or Metal, can craft and install a malicious application capable of recording a dump of uninitialized local memory (leftover from an earlier application) that may contain sensitive data. Additionally, the attacker can read data from another GPU kernel that is currently processing data, leading to the leakage of sensitive information considered private to an application, process, or user.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<h4 id="gpu-software-developers">GPU Software Developers</h4>
<p>GPU software developers are advised to review their vendor provided updates and use the latest available libraries and security capabilities to protect sensitive data in their applications. GPU software developers are also urged to review their applications for data privacy when leveraging such high-performance computing capabilities. </p>

        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/302671"/>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>A vulnerability has been found in the way that SMTP servers and software handle the end-of-data sequences (essentially the end of a single email message) in mail messages. An attacker can use this inconsistency to craft an email message that can bypass SMTP security policies.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>SMTP protocol (refer <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5321">RFC 5321</a> and <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5322">5322</a>), is an Internet based protocol for e-mail transmission and exchange. The SMTP protocol is used by multiple servers to relay emails as the email is exchanged between a sender and a recipient.  This handover of emails allows for a complex number of next-hop servers to interact and exchange emails before its delivery to the intended recipient.  A priority based Mail eXchange (MX) record also allows for emails to delivered to alternate servers or partner gateways to spool and deliver in cases of outages.  In order prevent fraudulent emails, email software and services authenticate a user and employ security policies such DMARC, essentially a combination of SPF and DKIM, to certify an email's origination as it traverse these various services.</p>
<p>Security researcher Timo Longin at SEC Consult discovered that the email software deployed across numerous SMTP servers treats the end-of-data sequence inconsistently. An attacker can exploit this inconsistency by crafting an email message that deviates from the standard end-of-data sequence, causing confusion as the message is transferred to its next hop. Any email server within the route of SMTP Gateways processing this manipulated message may interpret the submitted data as multiple messages, then process and relay them forward. Postfix software developer Wietse Venema explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The attack involves a COMPOSITION of two email services with specific differences in the way they handle line endings other than CR LF</p>
</blockquote>
<p>SEC-Consult researchers have labeled this vulnerability as "SMTP Smuggling" to discuss this problem that involves multiple stakeholders such as email service providers, email software vendors, email security product vendors and others that process and handle emails. </p>
<p><strong>VU#302671</strong>
An improper end-of-data sequence handling vulnerability in email software or services or appliances allow attackers to inject arbitrary email message that can bypass security policies.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/12/24/1">Openwall</a> community discussion also lead to the reservation of the following CVE numbers
    </p><table>
        <tbody><tr><td>Exim</td><td><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51766">CVE-2023-51766</a></td></tr>
        <tr><td>Postfix </td><td><a href="https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-51766">CVE-2023-51764</a> </td></tr>

    </tbody></table><p></p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker with access to an SMTP service can craft an email with improper end-of-data sequencing to submit two or more email messages that can be used to bypass security policy. When the attack is successful, the attacker can impersonate any sender in any domain that is hosted at the originating mail service. The attacker is then capable of avoiding In-place email handling policies, since email security scanners and gateways that analyze the message will fall prey to the improper sequencing of the message. A successful attack enables the attacker to impersonate any sender in any domain that is hosted at the originating mail service.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<h4 id="email-service-providers-and-administrators">Email Service Providers and Administrators</h4>
<p>Please ensure your email software is up to date and you have applied the right workaround and/or patches provided by your software vendor. Check the <em>Vendor Information</em> section for instructions and links to the either respective advisories. If you use Email Security Appliances or managed Email Gateways ensure their software is both up to date and is configured best to mitigate these attacks and reduce the risk of improper message relay to  other SMTP servers. Ensure any email backup MX records and services that may be hosted by partners are also protected from misuse or abuse.  Email service providers are also urged to ensure that the email sender verification and header verifications are performed on every email to ensure identity of the authenticated sender is properly represented in the submitted emails. </p>
<h4 id="email-end-users">Email end users</h4>
<p>As email sender verification continues to be a challenge in the Internet, email users are urged to continue their precaution when replying to emails to provide sensitive information or when clicking on links that can download or install malicious software.  </p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the TCP/IP stack (NetworkPkg) of Tianocore EDKII, an open source implementation of Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).  Researchers at Quarkslab  have identified a total of 9 vulnerabilities that if exploited via network can lead to remote code execution, DoS attacks, DNS cache poisoning, and/or potential leakage of sensitive information. Quarkslab have labeled these set of related vulnerabilities as PixieFail.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p><a href="https://uefi.org">UEFI</a> represents a contemporary firmware standard pivotal in initiating the operating system on modern computers and in facilitating communication between the hardware and OS. <a href="https://www.tianocore.org">TianoCore</a>'s EDKII stands as an open-source implementation adhering to UEFI and UEFI Platform Initialization (PI) specifications, offering an essential firmware development environment across platforms. Within EDKII, the NetworkPkg software encompasses a TCP/IP stack, enabling crucial network functionalities available during the initial Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE) stages. The PXE environment, when enabled, allows machines to boot via network connectivity, eliminating the need for physical interaction or keyboard access. Typically employed in larger data centers, PXE is vital for automating early boot phases, particularly in high-performance computing (HPC) environments.</p>
<p>Quarkslab researchers have discovered several vulnerabilities within the EDKII's NetworkPkg IP stack, introduce due to classic issues like buffer overflow, predictable randomization, and improper parsing. These vulnerabilities pose risks, allowing unauthenticated local attackers (and in certain scenarios, remotely) to execute various attacks. Successful exploits can result in denial of service, leakage of sensitive data, remote code execution, DNS cache poisoning, and network session hijacking. To successfully exploit this vulnerable NetworkPkg implementation, the attacker requires the PXE boot option to be enabled.</p>
<p>Tianocore's EDKII is used as a reference code or adopted as-is by many vendors for their UEFI implementation and distributed via supply-chain to other vendors in the PC market. Due to the widespread use of these libraries, these vulnerabilities may be present in a large number of implementations.  We recommend users consult vendor specific advisory and details that will help resolve these issues.  </p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The impact and exploitability of these vulnerabilities depend on the specific firmware build and the default PXE boot configuration. An attacker within the local network (and, in certain scenarios remotely) could exploit these weaknesses to execute remote code, initiate DoS attacks, conduct DNS cache poisoning, or extract sensitive information.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<h4 id="apply-updates">Apply updates</h4>
<p>Update to the latest stable version of UEFI firmware that includes fixes to these vulnerabilities. Please follow the advisory and any details provided by your vendor as part of this advisory. Downstream users of Tianocore EDKII that incorporate NetworkPkg should update to the latest version provided by <a href="https://github.com/tianocore/edk2">Tianocore project</a>.  Please follow any vendor provided recommended configurations that can limit the exposure of these vulnerabilities as suitable to your environment.</p>
<h4 id="enforce-network-security">Enforce network security</h4>
<p>In operations environments, you may consider the following workarounds to prevent exposure and potential exploitation of these vulnerabilities
* Disable PXE boot if it is not used or supported in your computing environment. 
* Enforce Network Isolation so the UEFI Preboot environment is available to specific network that is protected from unauthorized access.
* Deploy available protection to your computing environment from rogue DHCP services using capabilities such as<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DHCP_snooping"> Dynamic ARP inspection and DHCP snooping</a>.</p>
<h4 id="employ-secure-os-deployments">Employ secure OS deployments</h4>
<p>Follow <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/mem/configmgr/osd/plan-design/security-and-privacy-for-operating-system-deployment">security best practices</a> in design of the preboot environment that provide OS deployment capabilities to your organization.  UEFI supply-chain vendors should also consider migration to modern network boot environments that employ <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/technical/network-boot-in-a-zero-trust-environment.html">secure protocols</a> such as <a href="https://tianocore-docs.github.io/EDKIIHttpsBootGettingStartedGuide/draft/">UEFI HTTPS Boot</a> that can limit abuse of the legacy PXE boot related security issues. </p>

Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice.

Androxgh0st malware establishes a botnet for victim identification and exploitation in vulnerable networks, and targets files that contain confidential information, such as credentials, for various high profile applications. Threat actors deploying Androxgh0st malware have been observed exploiting specific vulnerabilities which could lead to remote code execution, including:
CVE-2017-9841 (PHP Unit Command)
CVE-2021-41773 (Apache HTTP Server versions), and
CVE-2018-15133 (Laravel applications).
In response, CISA is adding these CVEs to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog.
CISA and FBI encourage organizations to review and implement the mitigations found in the joint CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of cybersecurity incidents caused by Androxgh0st malware. For more information, visit CISA's Malware, Phishing, and Ransomware page.]]></summary>

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to disseminate known indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) associated with threat actors deploying Androxgh0st malware. Multiple, ongoing investigations and trusted third party reporting yielded the IOCs and TTPs, and provided information on Androxgh0st malware’s ability to establish a botnet that can further identify and compromise vulnerable networks.
The FBI and CISA encourage organizations to implement the recommendations in the Mitigations section of this CSA to reduce the likelihood and impact of cybersecurity incidents caused by Androxgh0st infections.

<p><b>Abstract:</b> Smart devices are used to facilitate cyberattacks against both their users and third parties. While users are generally able to seek redress following a cyberattack via data protection legislation, there is no equivalent pathway available to third-party victims who suffer harm at the hands of a cyberattacker. Given how these cyberattacks are usually conducted by exploiting a publicly known and yet un-remediated bug in the smart device&#8217;s code, this lacuna is unreasonable. This paper scrutinises recent judgments from both the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom and the Supreme Court of the Republic of Ireland to ascertain whether these rulings pave the way for third-party victims to pursue negligence claims against the manufacturers of smart devices. From this analysis, a narrow pathway, which outlines how given a limited set of circumstances, a duty of care can be established between the third-party victim and the manufacturer of the smart device is proposed...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[USN-6560-1 fixed several vulnerabilities in OpenSSH. This update provides
the corresponding update for Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and Ubuntu 18.04 LTS.

Original advisory details:

 Fabian Bäumer, Marcus Brinkmann, Jörg Schwenk discovered that the SSH
 protocol was vulnerable to a prefix truncation attack. If a remote attacker
 was able to intercept SSH communications, extension negotiation messages
 could be truncated, possibly leading to certain algorithms and features
 being downgraded. This issue is known as the Terrapin attack. This update
 adds protocol extensions to mitigate this issue. (CVE-2023-48795)

 It was discovered that OpenSSH incorrectly handled user names or host names
 with shell metacharacters. An attacker could possibly use this issue to
 perform OS command injection. This only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2023-51385)]]></summary>
