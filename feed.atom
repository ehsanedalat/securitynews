In response to recent malicious cyber incidents in Ukraine—including the defacement of government websites and the presence of potentially destructive malware on Ukrainian systems—CISA has published CISA Insights: Implement Cybersecurity Measures Now to Protect Against Potential Critical Threats. The CISA Insights strongly urges leaders and network defenders to be on alert for malicious cyber activity and provides a checklist of concrete actions that every organization—regardless of sector or size—can take immediately to: 
Reduce the likelihood of a damaging cyber intrusion, 
Detect a potential intrusion, 
Ensure the organization is prepared to respond if an intrusion occurs, and 
Maximize the organization’s resilience to a destructive cyber incident.
CISA urges senior leaders and network defenders to review the CISA Insights and implement the cybersecurity measures on the checklist.
