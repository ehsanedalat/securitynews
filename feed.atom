        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: February 25, 2022
CISA has added four new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence that threat actors are actively exploiting the vulnerabilities listed in the table below. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors of all types and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise.
CVE ID
			Vulnerability Name
			Due Date
		
CVE-2022-24682
			Zimbra Webmail Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
			3/11/2022
		
CVE-2017-8570
			Microsoft Office Remote Code Execution
			8/25/2022
		
CVE-2017-0222
			Microsoft Internet Explorer Remote Code Execution
			8/25/2022
		
CVE-2014-6352
			Microsoft Windows Code Injection Vulnerability
			8/25/2022
		

Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/383864"/>
        <updated>2022-02-24T19:51:20.581Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Visual Voice Mail (VVM) services transmit unencrypted credentials via SMS. An attacker with the ability to read SMS messages can obtain VVM IMAP credentials and gain access to VVM data.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>VVM is specified by <a href="https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/OMTP_VVM_Specification_1_3.pdf">Open Mobile Terminal Platform-OMPT</a> and is implemented with SMS and IMAP (and other protocols). VVM IMAP credentials are sent unencrypted in SMS messages. From <a href="https://gitlab.com/kop316/vvm-disclosure">vvm-disclosure</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a client sends any sort of STATUS SMS (activate, deactivate, status), the carrier will respond with all credentials needed to log into the IMAP server (i.e. username, password, server host-name).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From section 2.1.1.2 AUTHENTICATE of the <a href="https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/OMTP_VVM_Specification_1_3.pdf">OMTP VISUAL VOICEMAIL INTERFACE SPECIFICATION v1.3</a>: "The IMAP4 password is sent in the STATUS SMS message."</p>
<p>To intercept an SMS message, an attacker would need, for example:
*   temporary physical access to the SIM card,
*   to operate a spoofed a base station (cell tower), or
*   to convince a user to install a malicious application that has SMS access.</p>
<p>VVM IMAP services may be widely accessible over the internet or carrier networks.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://gitlab.com/kop316/vvm-disclosure">vvm-disclosure</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no indication on to a victim that someone else has access to their VVM. Android leaves their VVMs on the IMAP server until the client deletes it, so any VVMs on the client are accessible to a malicious actor.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker with the ability to read SMS messages can obtain VVM IMAP credentials and gain access to VVM data.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>We are not aware of a practical solution to this vulnerability.</p>
<p>Take general precautions against SMS interception.</p>
<p>If supported, change your VMM password on some basis.</p>
<p>Delete VMM data quickly.</p>
<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>Thanks to Chris Talbot for researching and reporting this vulnerability.</p>

The Sandworm actor, which the United Kingdom and the United States have previously attributed to the Russian GRU, has replaced the exposed VPNFilter malware with a new more advanced framework.
The United Kingdom's (UK) National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the National Security Agency (NSA), and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in the U.S. have identified that the actor known as Sandworm or Voodoo Bear is using a new malware, referred to here as Cyclops Blink.

The United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre, CISA, the National Security Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) reporting that the malicious cyber actor known as Sandworm or Voodoo Bear is using new malware, referred to as Cyclops Blink. Cyclops Blink appears to be a replacement framework for the VPNFilter malware exposed in 2018, which exploited network devices, primarily small office/home office routers and network-attached storage devices.
CISA encourages users and administrators to review joint CSA: New Sandworm Malware Cyclops Blink Replaces VPNFilter for additional technical details and mitigations.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: February 22, 2022
CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence that threat actors are actively exploiting the vulnerabilities listed in the table below. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors of all types and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise.
CVE ID
			Vulnerability Name
			Due Date
		
CVE-2022-23131
			Zabbix Frontend Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
			3/8/2022
		
CVE-2022-23134
			Zabbix Frontend Improper Access Control Vulnerability
			3/8/2022
		

Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/229438"/>
        <updated>2022-02-22T16:33:11.513Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The backend infrastructure shared by multiple mobile device monitoring services does not adequately authenticate or authorize API requests, creating an IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerability. These services and their associated apps can be used to perform non-consensual, unauthorized monitoring and are commonly called "stalkerware." An unauthenticated remote attacker can access personal information collected from any device with one of the stalkerware variants installed.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>IDOR is a common web application flaw that essentially exposes information on a server because of insufficient authentication or authorization controls. Multiple services and apps are affected by this backend vulnerability. A list of known vendors is included below. </p>
<p>For more information and a detailed account of the flaw and investigation, please see "<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/22/stalkerware-network-spilling-data/">Behind the stalkerware network spilling the private phone data of hundreds of thousands</a>." </p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An unauthenticated remote attacker can access personal information collected from any device with one of the stalkerware variants installed.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>We are unaware of a practical solution to this problem. The infrastructure provider (according to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/22/stalkerware-network-spilling-data/">TechCrunch investigation</a>, 1Byte Software), would need to address the IDOR vulnerability. </p>
<p>For advice on detecting and removing stalkerware apps, see "<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/22/remove-android-spyware/">Your Android phone could have stalkerware, here's how to remove it</a>." As noted by TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before you proceed, have a safety plan in place. The <a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/information-for-survivors/">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a> offers advice and guidance for victims and survivors of stalkerware. Spyware is designed to be covert, but keep in mind that removing the spyware from your phone will likely alert the person who planted it, which could create an unsafe situation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks to Zack Whittaker from TechCrunch for researching and reporting this vulnerability and investigating the wider security concerns related to stalkerware.</p>

CISA has compiled and published a list of free cybersecurity services and tools to help organizations reduce cybersecurity risk and strengthen resiliency. This non-exhaustive living repository includes services provided by CISA, widely used open source tools, and free tools and services offered by private and public sector organizations across the cybersecurity community.

Fix known security flaws in software.
Implement multifactor authentication.
Take steps to halt bad practices, including the use of end-of-life software products and systems that rely on known/default/unchangeable passwords.
Sign up for CISA’s Cyber Hygiene Vulnerability Scanning service.
Reduce your attack surface by getting your “Stuff Off Search (S.O.S.).”
CISA encourages network defenders to take the measures above and consult the list of free cybersecurity services and tools to reduce the likelihood of a damaging cyber incident, detect malicious activity, respond to confirmed incidents, and strengthen resilience.

The National Security Agency (NSA) has released a Cybersecurity Information (CSI) sheet with guidance on securing network infrastructure devices and credentials. Cisco devices are used globally to secure network infrastructure devices, including across the Department of Defense, National Security Systems, and the Defense Industrial Base. Credentials within Cisco configuration files could be at risk of compromise if strong password types are not used. The CSI reviews Cisco’s password type options, the difficulty to crack each password type, and its vulnerability severity and provides recommendations for use.
CISA encourages administrators to review NSA’s CSI: Cisco Password Types: Best Practices and consider the recommendations to secure sensitive credentials.

<blockquote><p>tl;dr</p>
<ul>
<li>In 2021, vendors took an average of 52 days to fix security vulnerabilities reported from Project Zero. This is a significant acceleration from an average of about 80 days 3 years ago.
<li>In addition to the average now being well below the 90-day deadline, we have also seen a dropoff in vendors missing the deadline (or the additional 14-day grace period). In 2021, only one bug exceeded its fix deadline, though 14% of bugs required the grace period.
<li>Differences in the amount of time it takes a vendor/product to ship a fix to users reflects their product design, development practices, update cadence, and general processes towards security reports. We hope that this comparison can showcase best practices, and encourage vendors to experiment with new policies.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: February 11, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence that threat actors are actively exploiting the vulnerability listed in the table below. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors of all types and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise.
CVE Number
			CVE Title
			Remediation Due Date
		
 CVE-2022-22620
Apple Webkit Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
2/25/2022
 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

<blockquote><p>Most security schemes facilitate the coercive processes of an attacker because they disclose metadata about the secret data, such as the name and size of encrypted files. This allows specific and enforceable demands to be made: “Give us the passwords for these three encrypted files with names A, B and C, or else…”. In other words, security often focuses on protecting the confidentiality of data, but lacks deniability.</p>
<p>A scheme with deniability would make even the existence of secret files difficult to prove. This makes it difficult for an attacker to formulate a coherent demand: “There’s no evidence of undisclosed data. Should we even bother to make threats?” A lack of evidence makes it more difficult to make specific and enforceable demands...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

Intelligence collectors are everywhere, and government spy agencies are drowning in data. This is a radical new world and intelligence agencies are struggling to adapt to it. While secrets once conferred a huge advantage, today open source information increasingly does.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: February 8, 2022
On February 8, 2022, SAP released security updates to address vulnerabilities affecting multiple products, including critical vulnerabilities affecting SAP applications using SAP Internet Communication Manager (ICM). SAP applications help organizations manage critical business processes—such as enterprise resource planning, product lifecycle management, customer relationship management, and supply chain management. Impacted organizations could experience:
theft of sensitive data,
financial fraud,
disruption of mission-critical business processes,
ransomware, and
halt of all operations.
Additionally, security researchers from Onapsis, in coordination with SAP, released a Threat Report describing SAP ICM critical vulnerabilities, CVE-2022-22536, CVE-2022-22532 and CVE-2022-22533. Onapsis also provides an open source tool to identify if a system is vulnerable and needs to be patched.
CISA recommends operators of SAP systems review SAP’s February 2022 Security Updates page, the Onapsis Research Labs Threat Report: SAP ICMAD Vulnerabilities, and the Onapsis GitHub page for more information and apply necessary updates and mitigations.

It&#8217;s a framework for private actors to scan every message sent online and report violations to law enforcement. And it might not stop there.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: February 4, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence that threat actors are actively exploiting the vulnerabilities listed in the table below. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors of all types and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise.
CVE Number
			CVE Title
			Required Action Due Date
		
CVE-2022-21882  
			Microsoft Win32k Privilege Escalation Vulnerability  
			02/18/2022
		
 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are two bills working their way through Congress that would force companies like Apple to allow competitive app stores. Apple hates this, since it would break its monopoly, and it&#8217;s making a variety of security arguments to bolster its argument. I have <a href="https://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2022/01/letter-to-the-us-senate-judiciary-committee-on-app-stores.html">written</a> a rebuttal:</p>
<blockquote><p>I would like to address some of the unfounded security concerns raised about these bills. It&#8217;s simply not true that this legislation puts user privacy and security at risk. In fact, it&#8217;s fairer to say that this legislation puts those companies&#8217; extractive business-models at risk. Their claims about risks to privacy and security are both false and disingenuous, and motivated by their own self-interest and not the public interest. App store monopolies cannot protect users from every risk, and they frequently prevent the distribution of important tools that actually enhance security. Furthermore, the alleged risks of third-party app stores and &#8220;side-loading&#8221; apps pale in comparison to their benefits. These bills will encourage competition, prevent monopolist extortion, and guarantee users a new right to digital self-determination...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <id>https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/796611</id>
        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/796611"/>
        <updated>2022-02-01T19:04:04.810Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The InsydeH2O Hardware-2-Operating System (H2O) UEFI firmware contains multiple vulnerabilities related to memory management in System Management Mode (SMM). </p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>UEFI software provides an extensible interface between an operating system and platform firmware.  UEFI software uses a highly privileged processor execution mode called System Management Mode (SMM) for handling system-wide functions like power management, system hardware control, or proprietary OEM-designed code.  SMM's privileges, also referred to as "Ring -2," exceed the privileges of the operating system's kernel ("Ring-0").  For this reason, SMM is executed in a protected area of memory called the SMRAM.  It is typically accessed via System Management Interrupt (SMI) Handlers using communication buffers, which are also known as "SMM Comm Buffers."  The SMM also provides protection against SPI flash modifications and performs boot time verifications similar to those performed by <a href="https://wiki.ubuntu.com/UEFI/SecureBoot#What_is_UEFI_Secure_Boot.3F">SecureBoot</a>.</p>
<p>UEFI software requires both openness (for hardware drivers, pluggable devices and Driver eXecution Environment (DXE) updates) as well as very tight security controls (for e.g., <a href="https://github.com/tianocore-docs/Docs/raw/master/White_Papers/A_Tour_Beyond_BIOS_Secure_SMM_Communication.pdf">SMM Comm Buffer Security</a>), making it a complex software that needs a thorough set of security controls that need validation throughout the software's lifecycle.  UEFI also supports recent capabilities like Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) for virtualization and the increasing demand of virtual computing resources. </p>
<p>Insyde's H2O UEFI firmware contains several (23) memory management vulnerabilities that were disclosed by <a href="https://www.binarly.io">Binarly</a>.  While these vulnerabilities were discovered in  <a href="https://www.fujitsu.com/global/">Fujitsu</a> and <a href="https://atos.net/en/">Bull Atos</a> implementations of Insyde H2O software, the same software is also present in many other vendor implementations due to the complex UEFI supply chain.  The vulnerabilities can be classified by the following <a href="https://medium.com/firmware-threat-hunting/uefi-vulnerabilities-classification-4897596e60af">UEFI vulnerability categories</a>.</p>
<table><thead><tr><td>Vulnerability Category</td> <td>Count </td>
    </tr>
    </thead><thead>
        </thead><tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>SMM Privilege Escalation</td><td> 10 </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
            <td> SMM Memory Corruption </td> <td>12 </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td> DXE Memory Corruption </td><td>1</td>
                </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>

<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The impacts of these vulnerabilities vary widely due to the nature of SMM capabilities. As an example, a local attacker with administrative privileges (or a remote attacker with administrative privileges)  can exploit these vulnerabilities to elevate privileges above the operating system to execute arbitrary code in SMM mode.    These attacks can be invoked  from the operating system using the unverified or unsafe SMI Handlers, and in some cases these bugs can also be triggered in the UEFI early boot phases ( as well as sleep and recovery like <a href="https://uefi.org/acpi">ACPI</a>) before the operating system is initialized. </p>
<p>In summary, a local attacker with administrative privileges (in some cases a remote attacker with administrative privileges)  can use malicious software to perform any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invalidate many hardware security features (SecureBoot, Intel <a href="https://edk2-docs.gitbook.io/understanding-the-uefi-secure-boot-chain/secure_boot_chain_in_uefi/intel_boot_guard">BootGuard</a>)</li>
<li>Install persistent software that cannot be easily erased</li>
<li>Create backdoors and back communications channels to exfiltrate sensitive data</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Install the latest stable version of firmware provided by your PC vendor or your nearest reseller of your computing environments.  See the links below to resources and updates provided by specific vendors.  </p>
<p>If your operating system supports automatic or managed updates for firmware, such as <a href="https://fwupd.org/">Linux Vendor Firmware Service</a> (LVFS), apply the related software security updates.  Binarly has also provided a set of UEFI software detection rules called <a href="https://github.com/binarly-io/FwHunt/tree/main/rules">FwHunt rules</a> to assist with identifying vulnerable software.  LVFS applies these FwHunt rules to detect and support the fix of firmware updates that are impacted by this advisory.</p>
<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>The efiXplorer team of Binarly researched and reported these vulnerabilities to Insyde Software.  Insyde Software worked closely with CERT/CC during the coordinated disclosure process for these vulnerabilities.</p>

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has released a Private Industry Notification (PIN) to warn entities associated with the February 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and March 2022 Paralympics that malicious cyber actors could use a broad range of cyber activities to disrupt these events. These activities include distributed denial-of-service attacks, ransomware, malware, social engineering, data theft or leaks, phishing campaigns, disinformation campaigns, and insider threats. Additionally, the FBI PIN warns Olympic participants and travelers of potential threats associated with mobile applications developed by untrusted vendors. The FBI urges all athletes to keep their personal cell phone at home and use a temporary phone while attending the events.
CISA encourages all travelers to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics to review FBI PIN: Potential for Malicious Cyber Activities to Disrupt the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics and apply the recommendations.

        <updated>2022-01-31T16:46:52.226Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The Samba <a href="https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/vfs_fruit.8.html">vfs_fruit</a> module allows out-of-bounds heap read and write via extended file attributes (CVE-2021-44142). This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The Samba <a href="https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/vfs_fruit.8.html"><code>vfs_fruit</code></a> module uses extended file attributes (EA, xattr) to provide "...enhanced compatibility with Apple SMB clients and interoperability with a Netatalk 3 AFP fileserver." Samba with <code>vfs_fruit</code> configured allows out-of-bounds heap read and write via specially crafted extended file attributes.</p>
<p>For more information, see the Samba announcement for <a href="https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2021-44142.html">CVE-2021-44142</a> and bug <a href="https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14914">14914</a>.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>A remote attacker with write access to extended file attributes can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of <code>smbd</code>, typically root.</p>
<p>From the Samba annoucement for <a href="https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2021-44142.html">CVE-2021-44142</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Access as a user that has write access to a file's extended attributes is required to exploit this vulnerability. Note that this could be a guest or unauthenticated user if such users are allowed write access to file extended attributes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<h4 id="apply-an-update">Apply an update</h4>
<p>Samba has <a href="https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2021-44142.html">released</a> versions 4.13.17, 4.14.12, and 4.15.5.</p>
<h4 id="disable-vfs_fruit">Disable vfs_fruit</h4>
<p>As a workaround, remove 'fruit' from 'vfs objects' lines in Samba configuration files (e.g., <code>smb.conf</code>).</p>
<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>Thanks to Orange Tsai of DEVCORE for researching and reporting this vulnerability. Thanks also to Samba, ZDI, and Western Digital for coordination efforts.</p>
