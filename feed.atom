<blockquote><p>The researchers said their break came when they understood that while Zeppelin used three different types of encryption keys to encrypt files, they could undo the whole scheme by factoring or computing just one of them: An ephemeral RSA-512 public key that is randomly generated on each machine it infects.</p>
<p>&#8220;If we can recover the RSA-512 Public Key from the registry, we can crack it and get the 256-bit AES Key that encrypts the files!&#8221; they wrote. &#8220;The challenge was that they delete the [public key] once the files are fully encrypted. Memory analysis gave us about a 5-minute window after files were encrypted to retrieve this public key.&#8221;...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

<blockquote><p>A cybersecurity expert examines how the powerful game whatever system is put before them, leaving it to others to cover the cost.</p>
<p>Schneier, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School and author of such books as <i>Data and Goliath</i> and <i>Click Here To Kill Everybody</i>, regularly challenges his students to write down the first 100 digits of pi, a nearly impossible task­&#8212;but not if they cheat, concerning which he admonishes, &#8220;Don&#8217;t get caught.&#8221; Not getting caught is the aim of the hackers who exploit the vulnerabilities of systems of all kinds. Consider right-wing venture capitalist Peter Thiel, who located a hack in the tax code: &#8220;Because he was one of the founders of PayPal, he was able to use a $2,000 investment to buy 1.7 million shares of the company at $0.001 per share, turning it into $5 billion&#8212;all forever tax free.&#8221; It was perfectly legal&#8212;and even if it weren&#8217;t, the wealthy usually go unpunished. The author, a fluid writer and tech communicator, reveals how the tax code lends itself to hacking, as when tech companies like Apple and Google avoid paying billions of dollars by transferring profits out of the U.S. to corporate-friendly nations such as Ireland, then offshoring the “disappeared” dollars to Bermuda, the Caymans, and other havens. Every system contains trap doors that can be breached to advantage. For example, Schneier cites &#8220;the Pudding Guy,&#8221; who hacked an airline miles program by buying low-cost pudding cups in a promotion that, for $3,150, netted him 1.2 million miles and &#8220;lifetime Gold frequent flier status.&#8221; Since it was all within the letter if not the spirit of the offer, &#8220;the company paid up.&#8221; The companies often do, because they’re gaming systems themselves. &#8220;Any rule can be hacked,&#8221; notes the author, be it a religious dietary restriction or a legislative procedure. With technology, &#8220;we can hack more, faster, better,&#8221; requiring diligent monitoring and a demand that everyone play by rules that have been hardened against tampering...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

This publication follows the August 2022 release of guidance for developers and October 2022 release of guidance for suppliers.
The guidance released today, along with its accompanying fact sheet, provides recommended practices for software customers to ensure the integrity and security of software during the procuring and deployment phases.
The Securing Software Supply Chain Series is an output of the Enduring Security Framework (ESF), a public-private cross-sector working group led by NSA and CISA. This series complements other U.S. government efforts underway to help the software ecosystem secure the supply chain, such as the software bill of materials (SBOM) community.
CISA encourages all organizations that participate in the software supply chain to review the guidance. See CISA’s Information and Communications Technology (ICT) Supply Chain Risk Management Task Force, ICT Supply Chain Resource Library, and National Risk Management Center (NRMC) webpages for additional guidance.

Summary
From mid-June through mid-July 2022, CISA conducted an incident response engagement at a Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) organization where CISA observed suspected advanced persistent threat (APT) activity. In the course of incident response activities, CISA determined that cyber threat actors exploited the Log4Shell vulnerability in an unpatched VMware Horizon server, installed XMRig crypto mining software, moved laterally to the domain controller (DC), compromised credentials, and then implanted Ngrok reverse proxies on several hosts to maintain persistence. CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) assess that the FCEB network was compromised by Iranian government-sponsored APT actors.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: November 16, 2022
Today, CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) published a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Actors Compromise Federal Network, Deploy Crypto Miner, Credential Harvester. The CSA provides information on an incident at a Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) organization in which Iranian government-sponsored APT actors exploited a Log4Shell vulnerability in unpatched VMware Horizon server.
The CSA includes a malware analysis report (MAR), MAR-10387061-1-v1 XMRig Cryptocurrency Mining Software, on the mining software that the APT actors used against the compromised FCEB network. The CSA also provides tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) obtained from the incident response as well as recommended mitigations.
CISA and FBI strongly recommend organizations apply the recommended mitigations and defensive measures, which include:
Updating affected VMware Horizon and unified access gateway (UAG) systems to the latest version.
Minimizing your organization’s internet-facing attack surface.
Exercising, testing, and validating your organization's security program against the threat behaviors mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK for Enterprise framework in the CSA.
Testing your organization’s existing security controls against the ATT&CK techniques described in the CSA.

<p><strong>CVE-2022-23122</strong>
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<p>The specific flaw exists within the setfilparams function. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-23124</strong>
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<p>The specific flaw exists within the get_finderinfo method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-23125</strong>
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<p>The specific flaw exists within the copyapplfile function. When parsing the len element, the process does not properly validate the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length stack-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.</p>
<p><strong>CVE-2022-23123</strong>
This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Netatalk. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability.</p>
<p>The specific flaw exists within the getdirparams method. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a read past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of root.</p>
<p>For more detailed information, please review the Netatalk announcement. Also available for reference are releases detailing the information from ZDI &amp; Western Digital. </p>
<p>Netatalk does not regularly receive security updates, is receiving security research attention, and is difficlut to get right because reverse engineering a proprietary protocol. WD has removed Netatalk code from NAS firmware. We suggest Samba+vfs_fruit for longer term use (more likely to get security updates in a timely way).
(see samba vfs_fruit vuls).</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An unauthenticated, remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Netatalk.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Netatalk has released version <a href="https://netatalk.sourceforge.io/3.1/ReleaseNotes3.1.13.html">3.1.13</a>. </p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: November 14, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: November 10, 2022
Today CISA published its guide on Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC), a vulnerability management methodology that assesses vulnerabilities and prioritizes remediation efforts based on exploitation status, impacts to safety, and prevalence of the affected product in a singular system.
As stated in Executive Assistant Director (EAD) Eric Goldstein's blog post Transforming the Vulnerability Management Landscape, implementing a methodology, such as SSVC, is a critical step to advancing the vulnerability management ecosystem. Additionally, the blog details advances—including
CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) machine-readable security advisories, and the Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX)—that, used in conjunction with SSVC, will reduce the window cyber threat actors have to exploit networks.
CISA encourages organizations to read EAD Goldstein's blog post and to use the following resources on the SSVC webpage to strengthen their vulnerability management processes:
CISA's SSVC decision tree
SSVC Guide on using SSVC and the SSVC decision tree
SSVC Calculator for prioritizing vulnerability responses in an organization’s respective environment

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Multiple Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) implementations are vulnerable to code execution in System Management Mode (SMM) by an attacker who gains administrative privileges on the local machine. An attacker can corrupt the memory using Direct Memory Access (DMA) timing attacks that can lead to code execution. These threats are collectively referred to as RingHopper attacks.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The UEFI standard provides an open specification that defines a software interface between an operating system (OS) and the device hardware on the system.  UEFI can interface directly with hardware below the OS using SMM, a high-privilege CPU mode.  <a href="https://edk2-docs.gitbook.io/edk-ii-secure-coding-guide/secure_coding_guidelines_intel_platforms/smm">SMM operations</a> are closely managed by the CPU using a dedicated portion of memory called the SMRAM.  The SMM can only be entered through System Management Interrupt (SMI) Handlers using a communication buffer.  SMI Handlers are essentially a system-call to access the CPU's SMRAM from its current operating mode, typically Protected Mode.</p>
<p>A race condition involving the access and validation of the SMRAM can be achieved using DMA timing attacks that rely on time-of-use (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use">TOCTOU</a>) conditions. An attacker can use well-timed probing to try and overwrite the contents of SMRAM with arbitrary data, leading to attacker code being executed with the same elevated-privileges available to the CPU (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Mode">Ring -2 mode</a>).  The asynchronous nature of SMRAM access via DMA controllers enables the attacker to perform such unauthorized access and bypass the verifications normally provided by the SMI Handler API.  </p>
<p>The Intel-VT and Intel VT-d technologies provide some protection against DMA attacks using Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) to address DMA threats.  Although IOMMU can protect from DMA hardware attacks, SMI Handlers vulnerable to RingHopper may still be abused.  SMRAM verification involving <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/another-brick-in-the-wall-uncovering-smm-vulnerabilities-in-hp-firmware/">validation of nested pointers</a> adds even more complexity when analyzing how various SMI Handlers are used in UEFI. </p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker with either local or remote administrative privileges can exploit DMA timing attacks to elevate privileges beyond the operating system and execute arbitrary code in SMM mode (Ring -2). These attacks can be invoked from the OS using vulnerable SMI Handlers.  In some cases, the vulnerabilities can be triggered in the UEFI early boot phases (as well as sleep and recovery) before the operating system is fully initialized.</p>
<p>A successful attack enables any of the following impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invalidation or bypass of UEFI security features (SecureBoot, Intel BootGuard).</li>
<li>Installation of persistent software that cannot be easily detected or erased.</li>
<li>Creation of backdoors and back communications channels to exfiltrate sensitive data</li>
<li>Interruption of system execution leading to permanent shutdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because these attacks are against UEFI supported firmware, OS and EDR solutions may have diminished visibility into unauthorized access.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Install the latest stable version of UEFI firmware provided by your PC vendor or by the reseller of your computing environments. See the links below for resources and updates provided by specific vendors to address these issues.  </p>
<p>If your operating system supports automatic or managed updates for firmware, such as Linux Vendor Firmware Service (<a href="https://fwupd.org/lvfs/docs/users">LVFS</a>), check (<code>fwupdmgr get-updates</code>) and apply the firmware updates provided by LVFS using <code>fwupdmgr update</code> as appropriate. </p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: November 8, 2022
CISA has added seven vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <id>https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/794340</id>
        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/794340"/>
        <updated>2022-11-01T23:01:07.697Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.6. These vulnerabilities were introduced in version 3.0.0 with the inclusion of support for punycode email address parsing for X.509 certificates.   OpenSSL's assessment of the severity of the vulnerabilities has <a href="https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2022/11/01/email-address-overflows/">reduced from CRITICAL to HIGH</a>, and OpenSSL 3.0.7 addresses the issues.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Two buffer overflows have been reported in the OpenSSL 3.0.x branch prior to version 3.0.7 that, when exploited, may lead to denial of services or, in some cases, remote code execution in the vulnerable target environment. OpenSSL client and server implementations that use the vulnerable libraries are affected.  The server implementation also requires that <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4346#appendix-F.1.1">TLS client authentication</a> is enabled in order to attack, and potentially exploit, a vulnerable target.   <a href="https://gist.github.com/FiloSottile/611fc3fa95c3aceebf2580983f76148c">OpenSSL provides details:</a> </p>
<pre><code>* Fixed two buffer overflows in punycode decoding functions.

   A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
   specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after
   certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to
   have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue
   certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted
   issuer.

   In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious
   server.  In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests
   client authentication and a malicious client connects.

   An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow
   an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.`  character (decimal 46)
   on the stack.  This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a
   denial of service).
   ([CVE-2022-3786])

   An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four
   attacker-controlled bytes on the stack.  This buffer overflow could
   result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code
   execution depending on stack layout for any given platform/compiler.
   ([CVE-2022-3602])
</code></pre>

<p>OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected.</p>
<p>CERT/CC is unaware of any exploitation of this vulnerability at this time.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Successful exploitation could lead to denial of service or remote execution of arbitrary code in the target environment.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Any services depending on versions of OpenSSL 3.0.x prior to OpenSSL 3.0.7 should be upgraded to version 3.0.7 or later.  Operators may also consider temporarily disabling TLS client authentication until applying an update.</p>
<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>

OpenSSL has released a security advisory to address two vulnerabilities, CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786, affecting OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.6.
Both CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 can cause a denial of service. According to OpenSSL, a cyber threat actor leveraging CVE-2022-3786, "can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution," allowing them to take control of an affected system.
CISA encourages users and administrators to review the OpenSSL advisory, blog, OpenSSL 3.0.7 announcement, and upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.7. For additional information on affected products, see the 2022 OpenSSL vulnerability - CVE-2022-3602 GitHub repository, jointly maintained by the Netherland's National Cyber Security Centrum (NCSC-NL) and CISA.

Addresses. If a certificate authority were tricked into signing a
specially-crafted certificate, a remote attacker could possibly use this
issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. The
default compiler options for affected releases reduce the vulnerability to
a denial of service. (CVE-2022-3602, CVE-2022-3786)

It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled applications creating
custom ciphers via the legacy EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() function. This issue
could cause certain applications that mishandled values to the function to
possibly end up with a NULL cipher and messages in plaintext.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: October 31, 2022
CISA has released two fact sheets to highlight threats against accounts and systems using certain forms of multifactor authentication (MFA). CISA strongly urges all organizations to implement phishing-resistant MFA to protect against phishing and other known cyber threats. If an organization using mobile push-notification-based MFA is unable to implement phishing-resistant MFA, CISA recommends using number matching to mitigate MFA fatigue. Although number matching is not as strong as phishing-resistant MFA, it is one of best interim mitigation for organizations who may not immediately be able to implement phishing-resistant MFA.  
CISA recommends users and organizations see CISA fact sheets Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA and Implementing Number Matching in MFA Applications. Visit CISA.gov/MFA for more information on MFA, including an infographic of the hierarchy of MFA options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: October 28, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: October 25, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.      
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: October 24, 2022
CISA has added six vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.      
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.
