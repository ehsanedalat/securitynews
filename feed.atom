It generalizes the term <i>hack</i> as a means of subverting a system&#8217;s rules in unintended ways.</p>

It&#8217;s not computer code, but it&#8217;s a series of algorithms&#8212;supposedly deterministic&#8212;that take a bunch of inputs about your income and produce an output that&#8217;s the amount of money you owe. This code has vulnerabilities; we call them loopholes. It has exploits; those are tax avoidance strategies. And there is an entire industry of black-hat hackers who exploit vulnerabilities in the tax code: we call them accountants and tax attorneys...</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: November 10, 2022
Today CISA published its guide on Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC), a vulnerability management methodology that assesses vulnerabilities and prioritizes remediation efforts based on exploitation status, impacts to safety, and prevalence of the affected product in a singular system.
As stated in Executive Assistant Director (EAD) Eric Goldstein's blog post Transforming the Vulnerability Management Landscape, implementing a methodology, such as SSVC, is a critical step to advancing the vulnerability management ecosystem. Additionally, the blog details advances—including
CISA's Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) machine-readable security advisories, and the Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX)—that, used in conjunction with SSVC, will reduce the window cyber threat actors have to exploit networks.
CISA encourages organizations to read EAD Goldstein's blog post and to use the following resources on the SSVC webpage to strengthen their vulnerability management processes:
CISA's SSVC decision tree
SSVC Guide on using SSVC and the SSVC decision tree
SSVC Calculator for prioritizing vulnerability responses in an organization’s respective environment

        <id>https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/434994</id>
        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/434994"/>
        <updated>2022-11-08T17:02:19.519Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Multiple Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) implementations are vulnerable to code execution in System Management Mode (SMM) by an attacker who gains administrative privileges on the local machine. An attacker can corrupt the memory using Direct Memory Access (DMA) timing attacks that can lead to code execution. These threats are collectively referred to as RingHopper attacks.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The UEFI standard provides an open specification that defines a software interface between an operating system (OS) and the device hardware on the system.  UEFI can interface directly with hardware below the OS using SMM, a high-privilege CPU mode.  <a href="https://edk2-docs.gitbook.io/edk-ii-secure-coding-guide/secure_coding_guidelines_intel_platforms/smm">SMM operations</a> are closely managed by the CPU using a dedicated portion of memory called the SMRAM.  The SMM can only be entered through System Management Interrupt (SMI) Handlers using a communication buffer.  SMI Handlers are essentially a system-call to access the CPU's SMRAM from its current operating mode, typically Protected Mode.</p>
<p>A race condition involving the access and validation of the SMRAM can be achieved using DMA timing attacks that rely on time-of-use (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check_to_time-of-use">TOCTOU</a>) conditions. An attacker can use well-timed probing to try and overwrite the contents of SMRAM with arbitrary data, leading to attacker code being executed with the same elevated-privileges available to the CPU (i.e., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Management_Mode">Ring -2 mode</a>).  The asynchronous nature of SMRAM access via DMA controllers enables the attacker to perform such unauthorized access and bypass the verifications normally provided by the SMI Handler API.  </p>
<p>The Intel-VT and Intel VT-d technologies provide some protection against DMA attacks using Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) to address DMA threats.  Although IOMMU can protect from DMA hardware attacks, SMI Handlers vulnerable to RingHopper may still be abused.  SMRAM verification involving <a href="https://www.sentinelone.com/labs/another-brick-in-the-wall-uncovering-smm-vulnerabilities-in-hp-firmware/">validation of nested pointers</a> adds even more complexity when analyzing how various SMI Handlers are used in UEFI. </p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker with either local or remote administrative privileges can exploit DMA timing attacks to elevate privileges beyond the operating system and execute arbitrary code in SMM mode (Ring -2). These attacks can be invoked from the OS using vulnerable SMI Handlers.  In some cases, the vulnerabilities can be triggered in the UEFI early boot phases (as well as sleep and recovery) before the operating system is fully initialized.</p>
<p>A successful attack enables any of the following impacts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invalidation or bypass of UEFI security features (SecureBoot, Intel BootGuard).</li>
<li>Installation of persistent software that cannot be easily detected or erased.</li>
<li>Creation of backdoors and back communications channels to exfiltrate sensitive data</li>
<li>Interruption of system execution leading to permanent shutdown.</li>
</ul>
<p>Because these attacks are against UEFI supported firmware, OS and EDR solutions may have diminished visibility into unauthorized access.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Install the latest stable version of UEFI firmware provided by your PC vendor or by the reseller of your computing environments. See the links below for resources and updates provided by specific vendors to address these issues.  </p>
<p>If your operating system supports automatic or managed updates for firmware, such as Linux Vendor Firmware Service (<a href="https://fwupd.org/lvfs/docs/users">LVFS</a>), check (<code>fwupdmgr get-updates</code>) and apply the firmware updates provided by LVFS using <code>fwupdmgr update</code> as appropriate. </p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: November 8, 2022
CISA has added seven vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <id>https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/794340</id>
        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/794340"/>
        <updated>2022-11-01T23:01:07.697Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.6. These vulnerabilities were introduced in version 3.0.0 with the inclusion of support for punycode email address parsing for X.509 certificates.   OpenSSL's assessment of the severity of the vulnerabilities has <a href="https://www.openssl.org/blog/blog/2022/11/01/email-address-overflows/">reduced from CRITICAL to HIGH</a>, and OpenSSL 3.0.7 addresses the issues.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>Two buffer overflows have been reported in the OpenSSL 3.0.x branch prior to version 3.0.7 that, when exploited, may lead to denial of services or, in some cases, remote code execution in the vulnerable target environment. OpenSSL client and server implementations that use the vulnerable libraries are affected.  The server implementation also requires that <a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4346#appendix-F.1.1">TLS client authentication</a> is enabled in order to attack, and potentially exploit, a vulnerable target.   <a href="https://gist.github.com/FiloSottile/611fc3fa95c3aceebf2580983f76148c">OpenSSL provides details:</a> </p>
<pre><code>* Fixed two buffer overflows in punycode decoding functions.

   A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
   specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after
   certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to
   have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue
   certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted
   issuer.

   In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious
   server.  In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests
   client authentication and a malicious client connects.

   An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow
   an arbitrary number of bytes containing the `.`  character (decimal 46)
   on the stack.  This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a
   denial of service).
   ([CVE-2022-3786])

   An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four
   attacker-controlled bytes on the stack.  This buffer overflow could
   result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code
   execution depending on stack layout for any given platform/compiler.
   ([CVE-2022-3602])
</code></pre>

<p>OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected.</p>
<p>CERT/CC is unaware of any exploitation of this vulnerability at this time.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Successful exploitation could lead to denial of service or remote execution of arbitrary code in the target environment.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>Any services depending on versions of OpenSSL 3.0.x prior to OpenSSL 3.0.7 should be upgraded to version 3.0.7 or later.  Operators may also consider temporarily disabling TLS client authentication until applying an update.</p>
<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>Thanks to OpenSSL for coordinating and remediating the vulnerability. Polar Bear is credited as having discovered CVE--2022-3602. Viktor Dukhovni is reported as the source of CVE-2022-3786.</p>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: November 1, 2022
OpenSSL has released a security advisory to address two vulnerabilities, CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786, affecting OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.6.
Both CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 can cause a denial of service. According to OpenSSL, a cyber threat actor leveraging CVE-2022-3786, "can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution," allowing them to take control of an affected system.
CISA encourages users and administrators to review the OpenSSL advisory, blog, OpenSSL 3.0.7 announcement, and upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.7. For additional information on affected products, see the 2022 OpenSSL vulnerability - CVE-2022-3602 GitHub repository, jointly maintained by the Netherland's National Cyber Security Centrum (NCSC-NL) and CISA.

could cause certain applications that mishandled values to the function to
possibly end up with a NULL cipher and messages in plaintext.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: October 31, 2022
CISA has released two fact sheets to highlight threats against accounts and systems using certain forms of multifactor authentication (MFA). CISA strongly urges all organizations to implement phishing-resistant MFA to protect against phishing and other known cyber threats. If an organization using mobile push-notification-based MFA is unable to implement phishing-resistant MFA, CISA recommends using number matching to mitigate MFA fatigue. Although number matching is not as strong as phishing-resistant MFA, it is one of best interim mitigation for organizations who may not immediately be able to implement phishing-resistant MFA.  
CISA recommends users and organizations see CISA fact sheets Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA and Implementing Number Matching in MFA Applications. Visit CISA.gov/MFA for more information on MFA, including an infographic of the hierarchy of MFA options.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: October 28, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: October 25, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.      
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: October 24, 2022
CISA has added six vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.      
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: October 20, 2022
CISA has added two vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.      
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.
