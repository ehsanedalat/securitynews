        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[USN-5782-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Firefox. The update introduced
several minor regressions. This update fixes the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that Firefox was using an out-of-date libusrsctp library.
 An attacker could possibly use this library to perform a reentrancy issue
 on Firefox. (CVE-2022-46871)
 
 Nika Layzell discovered that Firefox was not performing a check on paste
 received from cross-processes. An attacker could potentially exploit this
 to obtain sensitive information. (CVE-2022-46872)
 
 Pete Freitag discovered that Firefox did not implement the unsafe-hashes
 CSP directive. An attacker who was able to inject markup into a page
 otherwise protected by a Content Security Policy may have been able to
 inject an executable script. (CVE-2022-46873)
 
 Matthias Zoellner discovered that Firefox was not keeping the filename
 ending intact when using the drag-and-drop event. An attacker could
 possibly use this issue to add a file with a malicious extension, leading
 to execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-46874)
 
 Hafiizh discovered that Firefox was not handling fullscreen notifications
 when the browser window goes into fullscreen mode. An attacker could
 possibly use this issue to spoof the user and obtain sensitive information.
 (CVE-2022-46877)
 
 Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were
 tricked into opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
 potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive
 information across domains, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-46878, 
 CVE-2022-46879)]]></summary>

The search and advertising giant is required to pay $9.5 million to D.C. and $20 million to Indiana after the states sued the company for charges that the company tracked users' locations without their express consent.

<blockquote><p><strong>Abstract:</strong> Eavesdropping from the user&#8217;s smartphone is a well-known threat to the user&#8217;s safety and privacy. Existing studies show that loudspeaker reverberation can inject speech into motion sensor readings, leading to speech eavesdropping. While more devastating attacks on ear speakers, which produce much smaller scale vibrations, were believed impossible to eavesdrop with zero-permission motion sensors. In this work, we revisit this important line of reach. We explore recent trends in smartphone manufacturers that include extra/powerful speakers in place of small ear speakers, and demonstrate the feasibility of using motion sensors to capture such tiny speech vibrations. We investigate the impacts of these new ear speakers on built-in motion sensors and examine the potential to elicit private speech information from the minute vibrations. Our designed system ...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: December 29, 2022
CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the Food and Drug Administration Office of Criminal Investigations (FDA OCI), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) detailing recently observed incidents of criminal actors using business email compromise (BEC) to steal shipments of food products and ingredients valued at hundreds of thousands of dollars. The joint CSA analyzes the common tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) utilized by criminal actors to spoof emails and domains to impersonate legitimate employees and order goods that went unpaid and were possibly resold at devalued prices with labeling that lacked industry standard “need-to-knows” (i.e., necessary information about ingredients, allergens, or expiration dates).
For more information, CISA encourages organizations to review the guidance provided by the FBI, FDA OCI, and USDA in joint CSA Criminal Actors Use Business Email Compromise to Steal Large Shipments of Food Products and Ingredients—whereby businesses are urged “to use a risk-informed analysis to prepare for, mitigate, and respond to cyber incidents and cyber-enabled crime.”

<p>WebKit bugs are often exploited when a person visits a malicious domain in their browser (or via the in-app browser). It&#8217;s not uncommon for bad actors to find vulnerabilities that target WebKit as a way to break into the device&#8217;s operating system and the user&#8217;s private data. WebKit bugs can be &#8220;chained&#8221; to other vulnerabilities to break through multiple layers of a device&#8217;s defenses...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

<blockquote><p>The idea is to start from scratch, to pretend we’re forming a new country and don’t have any precedent to deal with. And that we don’t have any unique interests to perturb our thinking. The modern representative democracy was the best form of government mid-eighteenth century politicians technology could invent. The twenty-first century is a very different place technically, scientifically, and philosophically. What could democracy look like if it were reinvented today?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: December 14, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and poses a significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <updated>2022-12-13T16:42:06.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: December 13, 2022
CISA has added five new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose a significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.
