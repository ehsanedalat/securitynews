The National Security Agency (NSA) and CISA have updated their joint Cybersecurity Technical Report (CTR): Kubernetes Hardening Guide, originally released in August 2021, based on valuable feedback and inputs from the cybersecurity community. 
Kubernetes is an open-source system that automates deployment, scaling, and management of applications run in containers. A container is a runtime environment that contains a software package and its dependencies. Kubernetes is often hosted in a cloud environment. The CTR provides recommended configuration and hardening guidance for setting up and securing a Kubernetes cluster.
CISA encourages users and administrators to review the updated Kubernetes Hardening Guide—which includes additional detail and explanations—and apply the hardening measures and mitigations to manage associated risks.

Multifactor Authentication (MFA): A Cybersecurity Essential
The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to warn organizations that Russian state-sponsored cyber actors have gained network access through exploitation of default MFA protocols and a known vulnerability. As early as May 2021, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors took advantage of a misconfigured account set to default MFA protocols at a non-governmental organization (NGO), allowing them to enroll a new device for MFA and access the victim network. The actors then exploited a critical Windows Print Spooler vulnerability, “PrintNightmare” (CVE-2021-34527) to run arbitrary c…]]></summary>

CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory that details how Russian state-sponsored cyber actors accessed a network with misconfigured default multifactor authentication (MFA) protocols. The actors then exploited a critical Windows Print Spooler vulnerability, “PrintNightmare” (CVE-2021-34527), to run arbitrary code with system privileges. The advisory provides observed tactics, techniques, and procedures, as well as indicators of compromise and mitigations to protect against this threat. 
CISA encourages users and administrators to review AA22-074A: Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Gain Network Access by Exploiting Default Multifactor Authentication Protocols and “PrintNightmare” Vulnerability. For general information on Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see cisa.gov/Russia. For more information on the threat of Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber actors to U.S. critical infrastructure, as well as additional mitigation recommendations, see AA22-011A: Understanding and Mitigating Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure and cisa.gov/shields-up.

<blockquote><p>Zelle’s immediacy has also made it a favorite of fraudsters. Other types of bank transfers or transactions involving payment cards typically take at least a day to clear. But once crooks scare or trick victims into handing over money via Zelle, they can siphon away thousands of dollars in seconds. There’s no way for customers &#8212; and in many cases, the banks themselves &#8212; to retrieve the money.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>It’s not clear who is legally liable for such losses. Banks say that returning money to defrauded customers is not their responsibility, since the federal law covering electronic transfers &#8212; known in the industry as Regulation E ­&#8211; requires them to cover only &#8220;unauthorized&#8221; transactions, and the fairly common scam that Mr. Faunce fell prey to tricks people into making the transfers themselves. Victims say because they were duped into sending the money, the transaction is unauthorized. Regulatory guidance has so far been murky...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

CISA has released a draft version of Applying Zero Trust Principles to Enterprise Mobility for public comment. The paper guides federal agencies as they evolve and operationalize cybersecurity programs and capabilities, including cybersecurity for mobility. The public comment period will close April 18, 2022.
Executive Order 14028:  Improving the Nation's Cybersecurity, issued May 12, 2021, requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch departments and agencies to adopt Zero Trust (ZT) architectures to protect the government’s information resources, of which federal mobility is an integral part. The guidance highlights the need for special consideration for mobile devices and associated enterprise security management capabilities due to their technological evolution and ubiquitous use.
CISA encourages interested parties to review Applying Zero Trust Principles to Enterprise Mobility and provide comment. See CISA Blog: Maturing Enterprise Mobility Towards Zero Trust Architectures for more information.

As long as the speech contains the device wake word (usually &#8220;Alexa&#8221; or &#8220;Echo&#8221;) followed by a permissible command, the Echo will carry it out, researchers from Royal Holloway University in London and Italy&#8217;s University of Catania found.

<p>From the abstract:</p>
<blockquote><p>In this work, we expose the cryptographic design and implementation of Android&#8217;s Hardware-Backed Keystore in Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy S8, S9, S10, S20, and S21 flagship devices. We reversed-engineered and provide a detailed description of the cryptographic design and code structure, and we unveil severe design flaws. We present an IV reuse attack on AES-GCM that allows an attacker to extract hardware-protected key material, and a downgrade attack that makes even the latest Samsung devices vulnerable to the IV reuse attack. We demonstrate working key extraction attacks on the latest devices. We also show the implications of our attacks on two higher-level cryptographic protocols between the TrustZone and a remote server: we demonstrate a working FIDO2 WebAuthn login bypass and a compromise of Google&#8217;s Secure Key Import...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: March 3, 2022
CISA has added 95 new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow on the of the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria. 
Note: prioritizing software updates that address known exploited vulnerabilities is one of the actions CISA encourages as part of the recent Shields Up recommendations to all stakeholders. CISA appreciates the contributions of Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC) partners to this recent addition to the catalog.

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> Among the many types of malicious codes, ransomware poses a major threat. Ransomware encrypts data and demands a ransom in exchange for decryption. As data recovery is impossible if the encryption key is not obtained, some companies suffer from considerable damage, such as the payment of huge amounts of money or the loss of important data. In this paper, we analyzed Hive ransomware, which appeared in June 2021. Hive ransomware has caused immense harm, leading the FBI to issue an alert about it. To minimize the damage caused by Hive Ransomware and to help victims recover their files, we analyzed Hive Ransomware and studied recovery methods. By analyzing the encryption process of Hive ransomware, we confirmed that vulnerabilities exist by using their own encryption algorithm. We have recovered the master key for generating the file encryption key partially, to enable the decryption of data encrypted by Hive ransomware. We recovered 95% of the master key without the attacker&#8217;s RSA private key and decrypted the actual infected data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful attempt at decrypting Hive ransomware. It is expected that our method can be used to reduce the damage caused by Hive ransomware...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: February 28, 2022
Broadcom Software—an industry member of CISA’s Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative (JCDC)—uncovers an advanced persistent threat (APT) campaign against select governments and other critical infrastructure targets in a publication titled Daxin: Stealthy Backdoor Designed for Attacks Against Hardened Networks. The Symantec Threat Hunter team, part of Broadcom Software, worked with CISA to engage with multiple governments targeted with Daxin malware and assisted in detection and remediation.
Daxin malware is a highly sophisticated rootkit backdoor with complex, stealthy command and control (C2) functionality that enabled remote actors to communicate with secured devices not connected directly to the internet. Daxin appears to be optimized for use against hardened targets, allowing the actors to deeply burrow into targeted networks and exfiltrate data without raising suspicions.  
CISA urges organizations to review Daxin: Stealthy Backdoor Designed for Attacks Against Hardened Networks for more information and for a list of indicators of compromise that may aid in the detection of this activity.
Report incidents related to this activity to CISA and/or the FBI via your local FBI field office or the FBI’s 24/7 CyWatch at (855) 292-3937 or CyWatch@fbi.gov.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: February 25, 2022
CISA has added four new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence that threat actors are actively exploiting the vulnerabilities listed in the table below. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors of all types and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise.
CVE ID
			Vulnerability Name
			Due Date
		
CVE-2022-24682
			Zimbra Webmail Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerability
			3/11/2022
		
CVE-2017-8570
			Microsoft Office Remote Code Execution
			8/25/2022
		
CVE-2017-0222
			Microsoft Internet Explorer Remote Code Execution
			8/25/2022
		
CVE-2014-6352
			Microsoft Windows Code Injection Vulnerability
			8/25/2022
		

Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/383864"/>
        <updated>2022-02-24T19:51:20.581Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Visual Voice Mail (VVM) services transmit unencrypted credentials via SMS. An attacker with the ability to read SMS messages can obtain VVM IMAP credentials and gain access to VVM data.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>VVM is specified by <a href="https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/OMTP_VVM_Specification_1_3.pdf">Open Mobile Terminal Platform-OMPT</a> and is implemented with SMS and IMAP (and other protocols). VVM IMAP credentials are sent unencrypted in SMS messages. From <a href="https://gitlab.com/kop316/vvm-disclosure">vvm-disclosure</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a client sends any sort of STATUS SMS (activate, deactivate, status), the carrier will respond with all credentials needed to log into the IMAP server (i.e. username, password, server host-name).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From section 2.1.1.2 AUTHENTICATE of the <a href="https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/OMTP_VVM_Specification_1_3.pdf">OMTP VISUAL VOICEMAIL INTERFACE SPECIFICATION v1.3</a>: "The IMAP4 password is sent in the STATUS SMS message."</p>
<p>To intercept an SMS message, an attacker would need, for example:
*   temporary physical access to the SIM card,
*   to operate a spoofed a base station (cell tower), or
*   to convince a user to install a malicious application that has SMS access.</p>
<p>VVM IMAP services may be widely accessible over the internet or carrier networks.</p>
<p>From <a href="https://gitlab.com/kop316/vvm-disclosure">vvm-disclosure</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There is no indication on to a victim that someone else has access to their VVM. Android leaves their VVMs on the IMAP server until the client deletes it, so any VVMs on the client are accessible to a malicious actor.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker with the ability to read SMS messages can obtain VVM IMAP credentials and gain access to VVM data.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>We are not aware of a practical solution to this vulnerability.</p>
<p>Take general precautions against SMS interception.</p>
<p>If supported, change your VMM password on some basis.</p>
<p>Delete VMM data quickly.</p>
<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>Thanks to Chris Talbot for researching and reporting this vulnerability.</p>

The United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre, CISA, the National Security Agency, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) reporting that the malicious cyber actor known as Sandworm or Voodoo Bear is using new malware, referred to as Cyclops Blink. Cyclops Blink appears to be a replacement framework for the VPNFilter malware exposed in 2018, which exploited network devices, primarily small office/home office routers and network-attached storage devices.
CISA encourages users and administrators to review joint CSA: New Sandworm Malware Cyclops Blink Replaces VPNFilter for additional technical details and mitigations.

Source code for these AirTag clones is available online.</p>
<p>So now we have several problems with the system. Apple&#8217;s anti-stalker security only works with iPhones. (Apple wrote an Android app that can detect AirTags, but how many people are going to download it?) And now non-AirTags can piggyback on Apple&#8217;s system without triggering the alarms.</p>
<p>Apple didn&#8217;t think this through nearly as well as it claims to have. I think the general problem is one that I have ...</p>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: February 22, 2022
CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence that threat actors are actively exploiting the vulnerabilities listed in the table below. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors of all types and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise.
CVE ID
			Vulnerability Name
			Due Date
		
CVE-2022-23131
			Zabbix Frontend Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
			3/8/2022
		
CVE-2022-23134
			Zabbix Frontend Improper Access Control Vulnerability
			3/8/2022
		

Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/229438"/>
        <updated>2022-02-22T16:33:11.513Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The backend infrastructure shared by multiple mobile device monitoring services does not adequately authenticate or authorize API requests, creating an IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference) vulnerability. These services and their associated apps can be used to perform non-consensual, unauthorized monitoring and are commonly called "stalkerware." An unauthenticated remote attacker can access personal information collected from any device with one of the stalkerware variants installed.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>IDOR is a common web application flaw that essentially exposes information on a server because of insufficient authentication or authorization controls. Multiple services and apps are affected by this backend vulnerability. A list of known vendors is included below. </p>
<p>For more information and a detailed account of the flaw and investigation, please see "<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/22/stalkerware-network-spilling-data/">Behind the stalkerware network spilling the private phone data of hundreds of thousands</a>." </p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An unauthenticated remote attacker can access personal information collected from any device with one of the stalkerware variants installed.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<p>We are unaware of a practical solution to this problem. The infrastructure provider (according to the <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/22/stalkerware-network-spilling-data/">TechCrunch investigation</a>, 1Byte Software), would need to address the IDOR vulnerability. </p>
<p>For advice on detecting and removing stalkerware apps, see "<a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/02/22/remove-android-spyware/">Your Android phone could have stalkerware, here's how to remove it</a>." As noted by TechCrunch:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before you proceed, have a safety plan in place. The <a href="https://stopstalkerware.org/information-for-survivors/">Coalition Against Stalkerware</a> offers advice and guidance for victims and survivors of stalkerware. Spyware is designed to be covert, but keep in mind that removing the spyware from your phone will likely alert the person who planted it, which could create an unsafe situation.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Thanks to Zack Whittaker from TechCrunch for researching and reporting this vulnerability and investigating the wider security concerns related to stalkerware.</p>
