        <id>https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/309662</id>
        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/309662"/>
        <updated>2022-08-11T19:04:56.804Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in signed 3rd party UEFI  bootloaders that allows bypass of the UEFI Secure Boot feature.   An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can bypass the UEFI Secure Boot feature and execute unsigned code during the boot process.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>UEFI firmware is software written by vendors in the <a href="https://uefi.org/node/4046">UEFI ecosystem</a> to provide capabilities in the early start up phases of a computer.  <a href="https://edk2-docs.gitbook.io/understanding-the-uefi-secure-boot-chain/secure_boot_chain_in_uefi/uefi_secure_boot">Secure Boot</a> is a UEFI standard that can be enabled and used to verify firmware and to protect a system against malicious code being loaded and executed early in the boot process, prior to the loading of the operating system.  </p>
<p>Security researchers at <a href="https://eclypsium.com">Eclypsium</a>  have found three specific UEFI  bootloaders that are signed and authenticated by Microsoft to be vulnerable to a security feature bypass vulnerability allowing an attacker to bypass Secure Boot when it is enabled. The vulnerable bootloaders can be tricked to bypass Secure Boot via a custom installer  (CVE-2022-34302) or an EFI shell (CVE-2022-34301 and CVE-2022-34303). As a vulnerable bootloader executes unsigned code prior to initialization of the the Operating System's (OS) boot process, it cannot be easily monitored by the OS or common Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tools.</p>
<p>The following vendor-specific bootloaders were found vulnerable:</p>
<ul>
<li>Inherently vulnerable bootloader to bypass Secure Boot<ul>
<li>New Horizon Datasys Inc (CVE-2022-34302) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>UEFI Shell execution to bypass Secure Boot<ul>
<li>CryptoPro Secure Disk (CVE-2022-34301)</li>
<li>Eurosoft (UK) Ltd (CVE-2022-34303)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An attacker can bypass a system's Secure Boot feature at startup and execute arbitrary code before the operating system (OS) loads.  Code executed in these early boot phases can provide persistence to an attacker, potentially loading arbitrary kernel extensions that survive both reboot and re-installation of an OS. It may also evade common OS-based and EDR security defenses.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<h4 id="apply-a-patch">Apply a patch</h4>
<p>Apply your vendor-provided security updates that address these vulnerabilities to block vulnerable firmware from bypassing Secure Boot.  Microsoft has provided details with their <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/kb5012170-security-update-for-secure-boot-dbx-august-9-2022-72ff5eed-25b4-47c7-be28-c42bd211bb15">KB5012170</a> article released on August 9th 2022.  Note, these updates can be delivered from your OEM vendor or the OS vendor to install an updated <a href="https://uefi.org/revocationlistfile">Secure Boot Forbidden Signature Database (DBX) </a>. </p>
<h4 id="enterprise-and-product-developers">Enterprise and Product Developers</h4>
<p>As DBX file changes can cause a system to become <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-pulls-security-update-after-reports-of-issues-affecting-some-pcs/">unstable</a>, Vendors are urged to verify the DBX updates do not cause the machine to be unusable.  Enterprises and Cloud Providers that manage large number of computers are also urged to do the required security updates and ensure DBX files are implemented reliably without any risk of boot failure.</p>

CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information. 
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.    
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.    
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

        <link href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/495801"/>
        <updated>2022-08-04T18:22:26.080Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Versions 1.1.5 and earlier of the mu HTTP deamon (muhttpd) are vulnerable to path traversal via crafted HTTP request from an unauthenticated user. This vulnerability can allow unauthenticated users to download arbitrary files and collect private information on the target device.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The muhttpd, hosted at <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/muhttpd/">SourceForge</a> as an opensource project, is a lightweight webserver.  This software is commonly used in customer premise equipment (CPE), such as home routers and small office routers, to provide device management capability through a web interface. The muhttpd supports the use of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Gateway_Interface">CGI</a> scripts that enable remote management of CPE devices.</p>
<p>A path traversal vulnerability in muhttpd (version 1.1.5 and earlier) could allow an unauthenticated attacker to read arbitrary content on the target device, including usernames and passwords, Wireless SSID configurations, ISP connection information, and private keys.  If remote management is enabled on a device running vulnerable version of muhttpd, this attack is possible from a remote network. Even in cases with restricted Local Area Network access, a vulnerable version of muhttpd can be accessed using other attack methods such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_rebinding/">DNS Rebinding</a>. </p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>An unauthenticated attacker can use crafted HTTP request to download arbitrary files or gather sensitive information from a vulnerable target device. In cases where remote management is enabled on a vulnerable device, a remote unauthenticated attacker can perform these attacks.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<h4 id="apply-updates">Apply Updates</h4>
<p>Update to the latest version of firmware/software provided by your vendor; see <a href="#vendor-information">Vendor Information</a> section for details.  Downstream developers of embedded systems should update muhttpd software (to version 1.1.7 or later) from <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/muhttpd/code/ci/main/tree/">SourceForget git repository</a>.</p>
<h4 id="disable-remote-management">Disable remote management</h4>
<p>Disabling remote management access, which thereby limits access strictly to local area network, can minimize the exposure introduced by the vulnerable software.  Use access control to limit remote management if remote management is desired from specific IP network locations. Additional mitigations are described in the <a href="https://derekabdine.com/blog/2022-arris-advisory">security researcher's advisory</a>. </p>
<h3 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h3>
<p>Thanks to Derek Abdine for reporting this vulnerability. </p>

Immediate Actions You Can Take Now to Protect Against Malware:
known exploited vulnerabilities.
This joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) was coauthored by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC). This advisory provides details on the top malware strains observed in 2021. Malware, short for “malicious software,” can compromise a system by performing an unauthorized function or process. Malicious cyber actors often use malware to covertly compromise and then gain access to a computer or mobile device. Some examples of malware include viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, and rootkits.[1]
In 2021, the top malware strains included remote access Trojans (RATs), banking Trojan…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: August 2, 2022 | Last revised: August 4, 2022
CISA and the Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) have published a joint Cybersecurity Advisory on the top malware strains observed in 2021. Malicious cyber actors often use malware to covertly compromise and then gain access to a computer or mobile device. As malicious cyber actors have been using most of these top malware strains for more than five years, organizations have opportunities to better prepare, identify, and mitigate attacks from these strains.  
CISA and ACSC encourage organizations to apply the recommendations in the Mitigations sections of the joint CSA. These mitigations include prioritizing patching all systems with known exploited vulnerabilities, enforcing multifactor authentication (MFA), securing remote desktop protocol (RDP) and other risky services, making offline backups of your data, and providing end-user awareness and training about social engineering and phishing. The appendix contains detection signatures organizations can employ in defending their networks. For more information on preventing malicious cyber actors from using 2021 top malware strains to exploit vulnerabilities, see:
•    CISA’s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog 
CISA’s Cyber Hygiene Services
CISA’s Choosing and Protecting Passwords
ACSC’s Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: July 29, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.
