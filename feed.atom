        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2023-46604 Apache ActiveMQ Deserialization of Untrusted Data Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2023-46747 F5 BIG-IP Authentication Bypass Vulnerability
CVE-2023-46748 F5 BIG-IP SQL Injection Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, CISA updated its guidance addressing two vulnerabilities, CVE-2023-20198 and CVE-2023-20273, affecting Cisco’s Internetworking Operating System (IOS) XE Software Web User Interface (UI).
The guidance now notes that Cisco has fixed these vulnerabilities for the 17.6 Cisco IOS XE software release train with the 17.6.6a update. According to Cisco's Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS XE Software Web UI Feature, fixes are still to be determined for the following Cisco IOS XE software release trains: 17.3, 16.12 (Catalyst 3650 and 3850 only). Cisco previously published the fixed release for 17.9, which is 17.9.4a, on Oct. 22. CISA urges organizations with the 17.9 and 17.6 Cisco IOS XE software release train to immediately update to the 17.9.4a and 17.6.6a releases, respectively.
CISA urges organizations to review:
CISA’s updated guidance
Cisco Security Advisory: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS XE Software Web UI Feature
Cisco Product Support: Software Fix Availability for Cisco IOS XE Software Web UI Privilege Escalation Vulnerability - CVE-2023-20198
Cisco Talos Threat Advisory: Active exploitation of Cisco IOS XE Software Web Management User Interface vulnerabilities
CISA has added CVE-2023-20198 (on Oct. 16, 2023) and CVE-2023-20273 (on Oct. 23, 2023) to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, which, per Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities, requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the specified due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, CISA announces the launch of a new version of Logging Made Easy (LME), a straightforward log management solution for Windows-based devices that can be downloaded and self-installed for free. CISA’s version reimagines technology developed by the United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), making it available to a wider audience.
Log management makes systems more secure. Until now, it has been a heavy lift for many targeted organizations, especially those with limited resources. CISA’s LME is a turnkey solution for public and private organizations seeking to strengthen their cybersecurity while reducing their log management burden.
As CISA’s newest shared services product offering, LME builds upon the success of the NCSC's log management solution, which was decommissioned in March 2023. CISA urges organizations to secure their Windows-based devices today by downloading the free LME technical solution.]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation.
CVE-2023-5631 Roundcube Webmail Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability
These types of vulnerabilities are frequent attack vectors for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risks to the federal enterprise. Note: To view other newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column—which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires Federal Civilian Executive Branch (FCEB) agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the catalog that meet the specified criteria.]]></summary>
