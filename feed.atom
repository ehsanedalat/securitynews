CISA has added 10 new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow on the of the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information. 
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

<ul>
<li>ESET researchers collaborated with CERT-UA to analyze the attack against the Ukrainian energy company
<li>The destructive actions were scheduled for 2022-04-08 but artifacts suggest that the attack had been planned for at least two weeks
<li>The attack used ICS-capable malware and regular disk wipers for Windows, Linux and Solaris operating systems
<li>We assess with high confidence that the attackers used a new version of the Industroyer malware, which was used in 2016 to cut power in Ukraine

They could follow bitcoins on the blockchain as they moved from address to address until they reached one that could be tied to a known identity. In some cases, an investigator could learn someone&#8217;s Bitcoin addresses by transacting with them, the way an undercover narcotics agent might conduct a buy-and-bust. In other cases, they could trace a target&#8217;s coins to an account at a cryptocurrency exchange where financial regulations required users to prove their identity. A quick subpoena to the exchange from one of Chainalysis&#8217; customers in law enforcement was then enough to strip away any illusion of Bitcoin&#8217;s anonymity...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

CISA has added three new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow on the of the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information. 
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

CISA has added four new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow on the of the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

        <updated>2022-04-01T14:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: April 1, 2022
Spring by VMWare has released Spring Cloud Function versions 3.1.7 and 3.2.3 to address remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability CVE-2022-22963 as well as Spring Framework versions 5.3.18 and 5.2.20 to address RCE vulnerability CVE-2022-22965, known as “Spring4Shell.” A remote attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities to take control of an affected system.
According to VMware, the Spring4Shell vulnerability bypasses the patch for CVE-2010-1622, causing CVE-2010-1622 to become exploitable again. The bypass of the patch can occur because Java Development Kit (JDK) versions 9 and later provide two sandbox restriction methods, providing a path to exploit CVE-2010-1622 (JDK versions before 9 only provide one sandbox restriction method).
CISA encourages users and administrators to immediately apply the necessary updates in the Spring Blog posts that provide the Spring Cloud Function updates addressing CVE-2022-22963 and the Spring Framework updates addressing CVE-2022-22965. CISA also recommends reviewing VMWare Tanzu Vulnerability Report CVE-2022-22965: Spring Framework RCE via Data Binding on JDK 9+ and CERT Coordination Center (CERT/CC) Vulnerability Note VU #970766 for more information.

CISA has added seven new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow on the of the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>The Spring Framework insecurely handles PropertyDescriptor objects, which may allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system.</p>
<h3 id="description">Description</h3>
<p>The <a href="https://spring.io/">Spring Framework</a> is a Java framework that can be used to create applications such as web applications. Due to improper handling of PropertyDescriptor objects used with data binding, Java applications written with Spring may allow for the execution of arbitrary code.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>By providing crafted data to a Spring Java application, such as a web application, an attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the affected application. Depending on the application, exploitation may be possible by a remote attacker without requiring authentication.</p>
<h3 id="solution">Solution</h3>
<h4 id="apply-an-update">Apply an update</h4>
<p>This issue is addressed in Spring Framework 5.3.18 and 5.2.20. Please see the <a href="https://spring.io/blog/2022/03/31/spring-framework-rce-early-announcement">Spring Framework RCE Early Announcement</a> for more details.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Abstract:</b> The retreating ice cover of the Central Arctic Ocean (CAO) fuels speculations on future fisheries. However, very little is known about the existence of harvestable fish stocks in this 3.3 million­–square kilometer ecosystem around the North Pole. Crossing the Eurasian Basin, we documented an uninterrupted 3170-kilometer-long deep scattering layer (DSL) with zooplankton and small fish in the Atlantic water layer at 100- to 500-meter depth. Diel vertical migration of this central Arctic DSL was lacking most of the year when daily light variation was absent. Unexpectedly, the DSL also contained low abundances of Atlantic cod, along with lanternfish, armhook squid, and Arctic endemic ice cod. The Atlantic cod originated from Norwegian spawning grounds and had lived in Arctic water temperature for up to 6 years. The potential fish abundance was far below commercially sustainable levels and is expected to remain so because of the low productivity of the CAO...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

CISA has added 66 new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow on the of the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

<blockquote><p>While NASA has a fully operational insider threat program for its <em>classified</em> systems, the vast majority of the Agency&#8217;s information technology (IT) systems &#8212; including many containing high-value assets or critical infrastructure &#8212; are <em>unclassified</em> and are therefore not covered by its current insider threat program. Consequently, the Agency may be facing a higher-than-necessary risk to its unclassified systems and data. While NASA&#8217;s exclusion of unclassified systems from its insider threat program is common among federal agencies, adding those systems to a multi-faceted security program could provide an additional level of maturity to the program and better protect agency resources. According to Agency officials, expanding the insider threat program to unclassified systems would benefit the Agency&#8217;s cybersecurity posture if incremental improvements, such as focusing on IT systems and people at the most risk, were  implemented. However, on-going concerns including staffing challenges, technology resource limitations, and lack of funding to support such an expansion would need to be addressed prior to enhancing the existing program...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

The National Security Agency (NSA) and CISA have updated their joint Cybersecurity Technical Report (CTR): Kubernetes Hardening Guide, originally released in August 2021, based on valuable feedback and inputs from the cybersecurity community. 
Kubernetes is an open-source system that automates deployment, scaling, and management of applications run in containers. A container is a runtime environment that contains a software package and its dependencies. Kubernetes is often hosted in a cloud environment. The CTR provides recommended configuration and hardening guidance for setting up and securing a Kubernetes cluster.
CISA encourages users and administrators to review the updated Kubernetes Hardening Guide—which includes additional detail and explanations—and apply the hardening measures and mitigations to manage associated risks.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are releasing this joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) to warn organizations that Russian state-sponsored cyber actors have gained network access through exploitation of default MFA protocols and a known vulnerability. As early as May 2021, Russian state-sponsored cyber actors took advantage of a misconfigured account set to default MFA protocols at a non-governmental organization (NGO), allowing them to enroll a new device for MFA and access the victim network.

CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory that details how Russian state-sponsored cyber actors accessed a network with misconfigured default multifactor authentication (MFA) protocols. The actors then exploited a critical Windows Print Spooler vulnerability, “PrintNightmare” (CVE-2021-34527), to run arbitrary code with system privileges. The advisory provides observed tactics, techniques, and procedures, as well as indicators of compromise and mitigations to protect against this threat. 
CISA encourages users and administrators to review AA22-074A: Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Actors Gain Network Access by Exploiting Default Multifactor Authentication Protocols and “PrintNightmare” Vulnerability. For general information on Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see cisa.gov/Russia. For more information on the threat of Russian state-sponsored malicious cyber actors to U.S. critical infrastructure, as well as additional mitigation recommendations, see AA22-011A: Understanding and Mitigating Russian State-Sponsored Cyber Threats to U.S. Critical Infrastructure and cisa.gov/shields-up.
