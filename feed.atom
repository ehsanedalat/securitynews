        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: July 29, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

<blockquote><p>The findings, which NJIT researchers will present at the Usenix Security Symposium in Boston next month, show how an attacker who tricks someone into loading a malicious website can determine whether that visitor controls a particular public identifier, like an email address or social media account, thus linking the visitor to a piece of potentially personal data.</p>
<p>When you visit a website, the page can capture your IP address, but this doesn&#8217;t necessarily give the site owner enough information to individually identify you. Instead, the hack analyzes subtle features of a potential target&#8217;s browser activity to determine whether they are logged into an account for an array of services, from YouTube and Dropbox to Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, and more. Plus the attacks work against every major browser, including the anonymity-focused Tor Browser...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

tricked into opening a specially crafted website in a browsing context, an
attacker could potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service,
obtain sensitive information, spoof the UI, bypass CSP restrictions, or
execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2200, CVE-2022-31736, CVE-2022-31737,

CVE-2022-34479, CVE-2022-34481, CVE-2022-34484)

It was discovered that an unavailable PAC file caused OCSP requests to
be blocked, resulting in incorrect error pages being displayed.
(CVE-2022-34472)

It was discovered that the Braille space character could be used to
cause Thunderbird to display the wrong sender address for signed messages.
An attacker could potentially exploit this to trick the user into
believing a message had been sent from somebody they trusted.
(CVE-2022-1834)

It was discovered that Thunderbird would consider an email with a
mismatched OpenPGP signature date as valid. An attacker could potentially
exploit this by replaying an older message in order to trick the user into
believing that the statements in the message are current. (CVE-2022-2226)]]></summary>

        <updated>2022-07-12T20:11:02.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: July 12, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

<blockquote><p>On Thursday, a security researcher who goes by Kevin2600 <a href="https://rollingpwn.github.io/rolling-pwn/">published a technical report</a> and videos on a vulnerability that he claims allows anyone armed with a simple hardware device to steal the code to unlock Honda vehicles.

<p>In a phone call, Kevin2600 explained that the attack relies on a weakness that allows someone using a software defined radio&#8212;<a href="https://greatscottgadgets.com/hackrf/">such as HackRF</a>&#8212;to capture the code that the car owner uses to open the car, and then replay it so that the hacker can open the car as well.

<blockquote><p>Our two-year investigation, including hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests and a comprehensive review of ICE’s contracting and procurement records, reveals that ICE now operates as a domestic surveillance agency. Since its founding in 2003, ICE has not only been building its own capacity to use surveillance to carry out deportations but has also played a key role in the federal government’s larger push to amass as much information as possible about all of our lives. By reaching into the digital records of state and local governments and buying databases with billions of data points from private companies, ICE has created a surveillance infrastructure that enables it to pull detailed dossiers on nearly anyone, seemingly at any time. In its efforts to arrest and deport, ICE has ­ without any judicial, legislative or public oversight ­ reached into datasets containing personal information about the vast majority of people living in the U.S., whose records can end up in the hands of immigration enforcement simply because they apply for driver’s licenses; drive on the roads; or sign up with their local utilities to get access to heat, water and electricity...</p></blockquote>]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Original release date: July 1, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the "Date Added to Catalog" column, which will sort by descending dates.
Note: CISA previously added and then removed today’s addition, CVE-2022-26925, to the KEV Catalog after determining that remediations associated with this vulnerability would break certificate authentication for many federal agencies. Details:
CVE-2022-26925 was mitigated by Microsoft’s June 2022 Patch Tuesday update. 
The Microsoft update also includes remediations for CVE-2022-26923 and CVE-2022-26931, which change the way certificates are mapped to accounts in Active Directory. These changes break certificate authentication for many federal agencies.
For this reason, CISA has also published a Knowledge Article that provides critical steps that must be followed to prevent service outages. Agencies should review this Knowledge Article carefully before beginning the mitigation process.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.    
Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.
