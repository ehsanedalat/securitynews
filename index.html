CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.      
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA has added six vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.      
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

                              <span>Many years ago, Matt Blaze and I talked about getting our hands on a casino-grade automatic shuffler and looking for vulnerabilities. We never did it—I remember that we didn’t even try very hard—but this article shows that we probably would have found non-random properties:
…the executives had recently discovered that one of their machines had been hacked by a gang of hustlers. The gang used a hidden video camera to record the workings of the card shuffler through a glass window. The images, transmitted to an accomplice outside in the casino parking lot, were played back in slow motion to figure out the sequence of cards in the deck, which was then communicated back to the gamblers inside. The casino lost millions of dollars before the gang were finally caught...</span>

                              <span>Interesting:
A recent study on giant squid that have washed ashore along the Sea of Japan coast has raised the possibility that the animal has a different reproductive method than many other types of squid.
Almost all squid and octopus species are polygamous, with multiple males passing sperm to a single female. Giant squids were thought to have a similar form reproduction.
However, a group led by Professor Noritaka Hirohashi, 57, a professor of reproductive biology in the Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences at Shimane University suspects differently...</span>

                              <span>Machine learning security is extraordinarily difficult because the attacks are so varied—and it seems that each new one is weirder than the next. Here’s the latest: a training-time attack that forces the model to exhibit a point of view: Spinning Language Models: Risks of Propaganda-As-A-Service and Countermeasures.”
Abstract: We investigate a new threat to neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models: training-time attacks that cause models to “spin” their outputs so as to support an adversary-chosen sentiment or point of view—but only when the input contains adversary-chosen trigger words. For example, a spinned summarization model outputs positive summaries of any text that mentions the name of some individual or organization...</span>

Moshe Kol, Amit Klein and Yossi Gilad discovered that the IP implementation
in the Linux kernel did not provide sufficient randomization when
calculating port offsets. An attacker could possibly use this to expose
sensitive information. (CVE-2022-1012, CVE-2022-32296)

Duoming Zhou discovered that race conditions existed in the timer handling
implementation of the Linux kernel&#x27;s Rose X.25 protocol layer, resulting in
use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-2318)

Roger Pau Monné discovered that the Xen virtual block driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared
communication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose
sensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-26365)

CISA has added two vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.      
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

WhatsApp does not protect metadata the way that Signal does. Signal knows nothing about who you are. It doesn’t have your profile information and it has introduced group encryption protections.

But we do basically the same thing in museums and hang the assets right out on the wall. So it’s our job, then, to either use technology or develop technology that protects the art, to hire honest guards that are trainable and able to meet the challenge and alert and so forth. And we have to keep them alert because it’s the world’s most boring job. It might be great for you to go to a museum and see it for a day, but they stand in that same gallery year after year, and so they get mental fatigue. And so we have to rotate them around and give them responsibilities that keep them stimulated and keep them fresh...</span>

                              <span>It was discovered that the SUNRPC RDMA protocol implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly calculate the header size of a RPC message payload.
A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel
memory). (CVE-2022-0812)

Moshe Kol, Amit Klein and Yossi Gilad discovered that the IP implementation
in the Linux kernel did not provide sufficient randomization when
calculating port offsets. An attacker could possibly use this to expose
sensitive information. (CVE-2022-1012, CVE-2022-32296)

Duoming Zhou discovered that race conditions existed in the timer handling
implementation of the Linux kernel&#x27;s Rose X.25 protocol layer, resulting in
use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-2318)

Roger Pau Monné discovered that the Xen virtual block driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared
communication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose
sensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-26365)

Roger Pau Monné discovered that the Xen paravirtualization frontend in the
Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared
communication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose
sensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-33740)

It was discovered that the Xen paravirtualization frontend in the Linux
kernel incorrectly shared unrelated data when communicating with certain
backends. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory).
(CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742)

Oleksandr Tyshchenko discovered that the Xen paravirtualization platform in
the Linux kernel on ARM platforms contained a race condition in certain
situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of
service in the host OS. (CVE-2022-33744)</span>

                              <span>It was discovered that the SUNRPC RDMA protocol implementation in the Linux
kernel did not properly calculate the header size of a RPC message payload.
A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel
memory). (CVE-2022-0812)

Moshe Kol, Amit Klein and Yossi Gilad discovered that the IP implementation
in the Linux kernel did not provide sufficient randomization when
calculating port offsets. An attacker could possibly use this to expose
sensitive information. (CVE-2022-1012, CVE-2022-32296)

Duoming Zhou discovered that race conditions existed in the timer handling
implementation of the Linux kernel&#x27;s Rose X.25 protocol layer, resulting in
use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-2318)

Roger Pau Monné discovered that the Xen virtual block driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared
communication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose
sensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-26365)

Roger Pau Monné discovered that the Xen paravirtualization frontend in the
Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared
communication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose
sensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-33740)

It was discovered that the Xen paravirtualization frontend in the Linux
kernel incorrectly shared unrelated data when communicating with certain
backends. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory).
(CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742)

Oleksandr Tyshchenko discovered that the Xen paravirtualization platform in
the Linux kernel on ARM platforms contained a race condition in certain
situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of
service in the host OS. (CVE-2022-33744)</span>

                              <span>Researchers have used thermal cameras and ML guessing techniques to recover passwords from measuring the residual heat left by fingers on keyboards. From the abstract:
We detail the implementation of ThermoSecure and make a dataset of 1,500 thermal images of keyboards with heat traces resulting from input publicly available. Our first study shows that ThermoSecure successfully attacks 6-symbol, 8-symbol, 12-symbol, and 16-symbol passwords with an average accuracy of 92%, 80%, 71%, and 55% respectively, and even higher accuracy when thermal images are taken within 30 seconds. We found that typing behavior significantly impacts vulnerability to thermal attacks, where hunt-and-peck typists are more vulnerable than fast typists (92% vs 83% thermal attack success if performed within 30 seconds). The second study showed that the keycaps material has a statistically significant effect on the effectiveness of thermal attacks: ABS keycaps retain the thermal trace of users presses for a longer period of time, making them more vulnerable to thermal attacks, with a 52% average attack accuracy compared to 14% for keyboards with PBT keycaps...</span>

CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.      
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

Abstract: Early backdoor attacks against machine learning set off an arms race in attack and defence development. Defences have since appeared demonstrating some ability to detect backdoors in models or even remove them. These defences work by inspecting the training data, the model, or the integrity of the training procedure. In this work, we show that backdoors can be added during compilation, circumventing any safeguards in the data preparation and model training stages. As an illustration, the attacker can insert weight-based backdoors during the hardware compilation step that will not be detected by any training or data-preparation process. Next, we demonstrate that some backdoors, such as ImpNet, can only be reliably detected at the stage where they are inserted and removing them anywhere else presents a significant challenge. We conclude that machine-learning model security requires assurance of provenance along the entire technical pipeline, including the data, model architecture, compiler, and hardware specification...</span>

A flawed logical condition allows a malicious actor to remotely trigger a NULL pointer dereference using a crafted negTokenInit token.
Impact
An attacker can use a specially crafted network packet to cause a vulnerable application to crash.
Solution
The latest version of code in the Heimdal master branch fixes the issue. However, the current stable release 7.7.0 does not include the fix. 
Acknowledgements
Thanks to the International Continence Society for reporting this issue.

CISA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the National Security Agency (NSA) have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) providing the top Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) used since 2020 by People’s Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber actors. PRC state-sponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known vulnerabilities to actively target U.S. and allied networks, including software and hardware companies to illegally obtain intellectual property and develop access into sensitive networks.
CISA, the FBI, and the NSA urge U.S. and allied governments, critical infrastructure, and private sector organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Top CVEs Actively Exploited by People’s Republic of China State-Sponsored Cyber Actors to increase their defensive posture and reduce the threat of compromise from PRC state-sponsored malicious cyber actors.
For more information on PRC state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISA’s China Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage, the FBI’s Industry Alerts, and the NSA’s Cybersecurity Advisories &amp; Guidance.

in the Linux kernel did not provide sufficient randomization when
calculating port offsets. An attacker could possibly use this to expose
sensitive information. (CVE-2022-1012, CVE-2022-32296)

Norbert Slusarek discovered that a race condition existed in the perf
subsystem in the Linux kernel, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1729)

It was discovered that the device-mapper verity (dm-verity) driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly verify targets being loaded into the device-
mapper table. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2503)

Domingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera discovered that the netfilter
subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle rules that truncated
packets below the packet header size. When such rules are in place, a
remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2022-36946)</span>

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and CISA have published a joint public service announcement that:
Assesses malicious cyber activity aiming to compromise election infrastructure is unlikely to result in large-scale disruptions or prevent voting.

The two vulnerabilities, tracked as CVE-2022-41040 and CVE-2022-41082, have been codenamed ProxyNotShell due to similarities to another set of flaws called ProxyShell, which the tech giant resolved last year.</span>

Moshe Kol, Amit Klein and Yossi Gilad discovered that the IP implementation
in the Linux kernel did not provide sufficient randomization when
calculating port offsets. An attacker could possibly use this to expose
sensitive information. (CVE-2022-1012, CVE-2022-32296)

Norbert Slusarek discovered that a race condition existed in the perf
subsystem in the Linux kernel, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1729)

It was discovered that the device-mapper verity (dm-verity) driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly verify targets being loaded into the device-
mapper table. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2503)

Domingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera discovered that the netfilter
subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle rules that truncated
packets below the packet header size. When such rules are in place, a
remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2022-36946)</span>

Summary
Actions to Help Protect Against Russian State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Activity:
From November 2021 through January 2022, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) responded to advanced persistent threat (APT) activity on a Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector organization’s enterprise network. During incident response activities, CISA uncovered that likely multiple APT groups compromised the organization’s network, and some APT actors had long-term access to the environment. APT actors used an open-source toolkit called Impacket to gain their foothold within the environment and further compromise the network, and also used a custom data exfiltration tool, CovalentStealer, to steal the victim’s sensitive data.

CISA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the National Security Agency (NSA) have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), Impacket and Exfiltration Tool Used to Steal Sensitive Information from Defense Industrial Base Organization, highlighting advanced persistent threat (APT) activity observed on a Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector organization’s enterprise network. ATP actors used the open-source toolkit, Impacket, to gain a foothold within the environment and data exfiltration tool, CovalentStealer, to steal the victim’s sensitive data.
Joint Cybersecurity Advisory AA22-277A provides the APT actors tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs). CISA, FBI, and NSA recommend DIB sector and other critical infrastructure organizations implement the mitigations in this CSA to ensure they are managing and reducing the impact of APT cyber threats to their networks.

                              <span>An ex-NSA employee has been charged with trying to sell classified data to the Russians (but instead actually talking to an undercover FBI agent).
It’s a weird story, and the FBI affidavit raises more questions than it answers. The employee only worked for the NSA for three weeks—which is weird in itself. I can’t figure out how he linked up with the undercover FBI agent. It’s not clear how much of this was the employee’s idea, and whether he was goaded by the FBI agent. Still, hooray for not leaking NSA secrets to the Russians. (And, almost ten years after Snowden, do we still have this much trouble vetting people before giving them security clearances?)...</span>

                              <span>Overview
Microsoft Exchange 2019 Cumulative Update 23 and earlier versions are vulnerable to a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack and remote code execution.  An authenticated attacker can use the combination of these two vulnerabilities to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary code on the target Exchange server. 
Description
Microsoft Exchange Server&#x27;s  Autodiscover service is a web service widely available to any Microsoft Exchange Web Services (EWS) client.  Since Microsoft Exchange version 2016, the Autodiscover service has become an integral part of the Microsoft Exchange system, and it is no longer independently provided by a Client Access server.  The Autodiscover service and a number of other privileged mailbox services are hosted on the default Internet Information Services server running on the Mailbox server.  
Cybersecurity company GTSC observed an abuse of the Autodiscover service in August of 2022 using a crafted URL SSRF attack, similar to the earlier ProxyShell vulnerability reported in August 2021.  The observed attack appears to have implemented CVE-2022-41040 to gain privileged access and CVE-2022-41082 to perform remote code execution via PowerShell.  Microsoft Security Research Center has acknowledged the vulnerability and provided guidance for mitigation.  The guidance highlights that Microsoft Exchange Online customers will be provided with detection and mitigation defenses automatically from Microsoft&#x27;s managed Infrastructure, informing them of any attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities. 
Impact
An authenticated remote attacker can perform SSRF attacks to escalate privileges and execute arbtirary PowerShell code on vulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers.  As the attack is targeted against Microsoft Exchange Mailbox server, the attacker can potentially gain access to other resources via lateral movement into Exchange and Active Directory environments.
Solution
Workaround guidance
Microsoft has provided guidance in their recent blog post to address the issue.  Jang notes that the guidance can be bypassed due to a small error in the URL filter .*autodiscover\.json.*\@.*Powershell.* which is detailed in step 6 under Option 3.  The recommended block pattern is  .*autodiscover\.json.*Powershell.* (excluding the @ symbol) as a regular expression to prevent known variants of the #ProxyNotShell attacks.
Apply update when available
As of October 3, 2022, there is no patch available to mitigate this issue. It is recommended that Microsoft Exchange administrators stay on alert for any advisory or patch released by Microsoft.  
Third-party web application protection
Exchange Administrators who use third-party Web Application Firewall (WAF) products can implement the recommended URL filters and blocks as part of their WAF policy.
Other mitigations
Exchange Administrators can limit the outgoing connection from the Exchange Mailbox server using specific whitelisting on an outgoing proxy to limit suspicious web requests.

                              <span>This is interesting research:
In this paper, we develop a new mechanism for detecting audio deepfakes using techniques from the field of articulatory phonetics. Specifically, we apply fluid dynamics to estimate the arrangement of the human vocal tract during speech generation and show that deepfakes often model impossible or highly-unlikely anatomical arrangements. When parameterized to achieve 99.9% precision, our detection mechanism achieves a recall of 99.5%, correctly identifying all but one deepfake sample in our dataset.

CISA warns users to remain on alert for malicious cyber activity targeting potential disaster victims and charitable donors following a hurricane. Fraudulent emails—often containing malicious links or attachments—are common after major natural disasters. Exercise caution in handling emails with hurricane-related subject lines, attachments, or hyperlinks. In addition, be wary of social media pleas, texts, or door-to-door solicitations relating to severe weather events.
To avoid becoming victims of malicious activity, users and administrators should review the following resources and take preventative measures.
Staying Alert to Disaster-related Scams
Before Giving to a Charity
Staying Safe on Social Networking Sites
Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks
Using Caution with Email Attachments
If you believe you have been a victim of cybercrime, file a complaint with Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at www.ic3.gov.

CISA has added three vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.      
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA has published its Traffic Light Protocol 2.0 User Guide and Traffic Light Protocol: Moving to Version 2.0 fact sheet in preparation for its November 1, 2022 move from Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Version 1.0 to TLP 2.0.
Managed by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), TLP is a system of markings that communicates information sharing permissions. According to FIRST, the purpose of TLP is &quot;to facilitate greater sharing of potentially sensitive information and more effective collaboration.&quot; Note: Unlike formal classification systems, TLP is not legally binding.
TLP Version 2.0 brings the following key updates:
TLP:CLEAR replaces TLP:WHITE for publicly releasable information.
TLP:AMBER+STRICT supplements TLP:AMBER, clarifying when information may be shared with the recipient’s organization only.
Note: CISA’s Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) capability will not update from TLP 1.0 to TLP 2.0 until March 2023. This exception includes AIS’s use of the following open standards: the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX™) for cyber threat indicators and defensive measures information and the Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII™) for machine-to-machine communications.
As CISA prepares to implement this update, we want to inform partners of the upcoming change and encourage all network defenders to adopt TLP Version 2.0 to facilitate greater information sharing and collaboration.
For more information on TLP, visit FIRST’s TLP webpage at www.first.org/tlp/. On November 1, 2022, CISA will update www.cisa.gov/tlp to reflect the TLP Version 2.0 changes.

                              <span>It was discovered that the framebuffer driver on the Linux kernel did not
verify size limits when changing font or screen size, leading to an out-of-
bounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33655)

Moshe Kol, Amit Klein and Yossi Gilad discovered that the IP implementation
in the Linux kernel did not provide sufficient randomization when
calculating port offsets. An attacker could possibly use this to expose
sensitive information. (CVE-2022-1012, CVE-2022-32296)

Norbert Slusarek discovered that a race condition existed in the perf
subsystem in the Linux kernel, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1729)

It was discovered that the device-mapper verity (dm-verity) driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly verify targets being loaded into the device-
mapper table. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2503)

Domingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera discovered that the netfilter
subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle rules that truncated
packets below the packet header size. When such rules are in place, a
remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2022-36946)</span>
