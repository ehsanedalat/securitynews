In response to recent malicious cyber incidents in Ukraine—including the defacement of government websites and the presence of potentially destructive malware on Ukrainian systems—CISA has published CISA Insights: Implement Cybersecurity Measures Now to Protect Against Potential Critical Threats. The CISA Insights strongly urges leaders and network defenders to be on alert for malicious cyber activity and provides a checklist of concrete actions that every organization—regardless of sector or size—can take immediately to: 
Reduce the likelihood of a damaging cyber intrusion, 
Detect a potential intrusion, 
Ensure the organization is prepared to respond if an intrusion occurs, and 
Maximize the organization’s resilience to a destructive cyber incident.
CISA urges senior leaders and network defenders to review the CISA Insights and implement the cybersecurity measures on the checklist.

                    <span>Original release date: January 12, 2022
U.S. Cyber Command’s Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF) has identified multiple open-source tools used by an Iranian advanced persistent threat (APT) group known as MuddyWater. According to CNMF, “MuddyWater has been seen using a variety of techniques to maintain access to victim networks. These include side-loading DLLs in order to trick legitimate programs into running malware and obfuscating PowerShell scripts to hide command and control functions.” U.S. Cyber Command has released malware samples attributed to MuddyWater to the malware aggregation tool and repository, VirusTotal.
CISA encourages users and administrators to review U.S. Cyber Command’s press release, Iranian intel cyber suite of malware uses open source tools, as well as their VirusTotal page for more information.
