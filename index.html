We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 Multiple security issues were discovered in Firefox. If a user were
 tricked into opening a specially crafted website, an attacker could
 potentially exploit these to cause a denial of service, obtain sensitive
 information across domains, or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-42927,
 CVE-2022-42928, CVE-2022-42929, CVE-2022-42930, CVE-2022-42932)
 
 It was discovered that Firefox saved usernames to a plaintext file. A
 local user could potentially exploit this to obtain sensitive information.
 (CVE-2022-42931)</span>

Today CISA published its guide on Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization (SSVC), a vulnerability management methodology that assesses vulnerabilities and prioritizes remediation efforts based on exploitation status, impacts to safety, and prevalence of the affected product in a singular system.
As stated in Executive Assistant Director (EAD) Eric Goldstein&#x27;s blog post Transforming the Vulnerability Management Landscape, implementing a methodology, such as SSVC, is a critical step to advancing the vulnerability management ecosystem. Additionally, the blog details advances—including
CISA&#x27;s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) catalog, Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF) machine-readable security advisories, and the Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX)—that, used in conjunction with SSVC, will reduce the window cyber threat actors have to exploit networks.
CISA encourages organizations to read EAD Goldstein&#x27;s blog post and to use the following resources on the SSVC webpage to strengthen their vulnerability management processes:
CISA&#x27;s SSVC decision tree
SSVC Guide on using SSVC and the SSVC decision tree
SSVC Calculator for prioritizing vulnerability responses in an organization’s respective environment

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/434994">

                              <span>Overview
Multiple Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) implementations are vulnerable to code execution in System Management Mode (SMM) by an attacker who gains administrative privileges on the local machine. An attacker can corrupt the memory using Direct Memory Access (DMA) timing attacks that can lead to code execution. These threats are collectively referred to as RingHopper attacks.
Description
The UEFI standard provides an open specification that defines a software interface between an operating system (OS) and the device hardware on the system.  UEFI can interface directly with hardware below the OS using SMM, a high-privilege CPU mode.  SMM operations are closely managed by the CPU using a dedicated portion of memory called the SMRAM.  The SMM can only be entered through System Management Interrupt (SMI) Handlers using a communication buffer.  SMI Handlers are essentially a system-call to access the CPU&#x27;s SMRAM from its current operating mode, typically Protected Mode.
A race condition involving the access and validation of the SMRAM can be achieved using DMA timing attacks that rely on time-of-use (TOCTOU) conditions. An attacker can use well-timed probing to try and overwrite the contents of SMRAM with arbitrary data, leading to attacker code being executed with the same elevated-privileges available to the CPU (i.e., Ring -2 mode).  The asynchronous nature of SMRAM access via DMA controllers enables the attacker to perform such unauthorized access and bypass the verifications normally provided by the SMI Handler API.  
The Intel-VT and Intel VT-d technologies provide some protection against DMA attacks using Input-Output Memory Management Unit (IOMMU) to address DMA threats.  Although IOMMU can protect from DMA hardware attacks, SMI Handlers vulnerable to RingHopper may still be abused.  SMRAM verification involving validation of nested pointers adds even more complexity when analyzing how various SMI Handlers are used in UEFI. 
Impact
An attacker with either local or remote administrative privileges can exploit DMA timing attacks to elevate privileges beyond the operating system and execute arbitrary code in SMM mode (Ring -2). These attacks can be invoked from the OS using vulnerable SMI Handlers.  In some cases, the vulnerabilities can be triggered in the UEFI early boot phases (as well as sleep and recovery) before the operating system is fully initialized.
A successful attack enables any of the following impacts:
Invalidation or bypass of UEFI security features (SecureBoot, Intel BootGuard).
Installation of persistent software that cannot be easily detected or erased.
Creation of backdoors and back communications channels to exfiltrate sensitive data
Interruption of system execution leading to permanent shutdown.
Because these attacks are against UEFI supported firmware, OS and EDR solutions may have diminished visibility into unauthorized access.
Solution
Install the latest stable version of UEFI firmware provided by your PC vendor or by the reseller of your computing environments. See the links below for resources and updates provided by specific vendors to address these issues.  
If your operating system supports automatic or managed updates for firmware, such as Linux Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS), check (fwupdmgr get-updates) and apply the firmware updates provided by LVFS using fwupdmgr update as appropriate.

CISA has added seven vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

A thief using the drone could find vulnerable areas in a home or office by checking for the absence of security cameras and other signs that a room is monitored or occupied.

                              <span>In 1878, a 55-foot-long giant squid washed up on the shores of Glover’s Harbour, Newfoundland. It’s the largest giant squid ever recorded—although scientists now think that the size was an exaggeration or the result of postmortem stretching—and there’s a full-sized statue of it near the beach where it was found.
As usual, you can also use this squid post to talk about the security stories in the news that I haven’t covered.

Prevention is often seen as the responsibility of the software developer, as they are required to securely develop and deliver code, verify third party components, and harden the build environment. But the supplier also holds a critical responsibility in ensuring the security and integrity of our software. After all, the software vendor is responsible for liaising between the customer and software developer. It is through this relationship that additional security features can be applied via contractual agreements, software releases and updates, notifications and mitigations of vulnerabilities...</span>

                              <span>Overview
Two buffer overflow vulnerabilities were discovered in OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.6. These vulnerabilities were introduced in version 3.0.0 with the inclusion of support for punycode email address parsing for X.509 certificates.   OpenSSL&#x27;s assessment of the severity of the vulnerabilities has reduced from CRITICAL to HIGH, and OpenSSL 3.0.7 addresses the issues.
Description
Two buffer overflows have been reported in the OpenSSL 3.0.x branch prior to version 3.0.7 that, when exploited, may lead to denial of services or, in some cases, remote code execution in the vulnerable target environment. OpenSSL client and server implementations that use the vulnerable libraries are affected.  The server implementation also requires that TLS client authentication is enabled in order to attack, and potentially exploit, a vulnerable target.   OpenSSL provides details: 
* Fixed two buffer overflows in punycode decoding functions.

   A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification,
   specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after
   certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to
   have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue
   certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted
   issuer.

   In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious
   server.  In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests
   client authentication and a malicious client connects.

   An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow
   an arbitrary number of bytes containing the &#x60;.&#x60;  character (decimal 46)
   on the stack.  This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a
   denial of service).
   ([CVE-2022-3786])

   An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four
   attacker-controlled bytes on the stack.  This buffer overflow could
   result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code
   execution depending on stack layout for any given platform/compiler.
   ([CVE-2022-3602])

OpenSSL versions 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 are not affected.
CERT/CC is unaware of any exploitation of this vulnerability at this time.
Impact
Successful exploitation could lead to denial of service or remote execution of arbitrary code in the target environment.
Solution
Any services depending on versions of OpenSSL 3.0.x prior to OpenSSL 3.0.7 should be upgraded to version 3.0.7 or later.  Operators may also consider temporarily disabling TLS client authentication until applying an update.

OpenSSL has released a security advisory to address two vulnerabilities, CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786, affecting OpenSSL versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.6.
Both CVE-2022-3602 and CVE-2022-3786 can cause a denial of service. According to OpenSSL, a cyber threat actor leveraging CVE-2022-3786, &quot;can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution,&quot; allowing them to take control of an affected system.
CISA encourages users and administrators to review the OpenSSL advisory, blog, OpenSSL 3.0.7 announcement, and upgrade to OpenSSL 3.0.7. For additional information on affected products, see the 2022 OpenSSL vulnerability - CVE-2022-3602 GitHub repository, jointly maintained by the Netherland&#x27;s National Cyber Security Centrum (NCSC-NL) and CISA.

                              <span>Original release date: November 1, 2022
Today, CISA officially upgraded to Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) 2.0, which facilitates greater information sharing and collaboration. CISA made this upgrade in accordance with the recommendation from the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams to upgrade to TLP 2.0 by January 2023.
Key TLP 2.0 updates:
TLP 2.0 changes TLP:WHITE to TLP:CLEAR.
TLP 2.0 adds the designation TLP:AMBER+STRICT, which instructs the recipient to keep the information strictly within their organization only.
Note: CISA’s Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) capability will not update from TLP 1.0 to TLP 2.0 until March 2023. This exception includes AIS’s use of the following open standards: the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX™) for cyber threat indicators and defensive measures information and the Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII™) for machine-to-machine communications.
CISA encourage all individuals and organizations in the cybersecurity community to adopt TLP 2.0. For more information, see CISA’s TLP webpage, www.cisa.gov/tlp and FIRST&#x27;s TLP webpage, https://www.first.org/tlp/.

                              <span>It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled certain X.509 Email
Addresses. If a certificate authority were tricked into signing a
specially-crafted certificate, a remote attacker could possibly use this
issue to cause OpenSSL to crash, resulting in a denial of service. The
default compiler options for affected releases reduce the vulnerability to
a denial of service. (CVE-2022-3602, CVE-2022-3786)

It was discovered that OpenSSL incorrectly handled applications creating
custom ciphers via the legacy EVP_CIPHER_meth_new() function. This issue
could cause certain applications that mishandled values to the function to
possibly end up with a NULL cipher and messages in plaintext.

                              <span>Original release date: October 31, 2022
CISA has released two fact sheets to highlight threats against accounts and systems using certain forms of multifactor authentication (MFA). CISA strongly urges all organizations to implement phishing-resistant MFA to protect against phishing and other known cyber threats. If an organization using mobile push-notification-based MFA is unable to implement phishing-resistant MFA, CISA recommends using number matching to mitigate MFA fatigue. Although number matching is not as strong as phishing-resistant MFA, it is one of best interim mitigation for organizations who may not immediately be able to implement phishing-resistant MFA.  
CISA recommends users and organizations see CISA fact sheets Implementing Phishing-Resistant MFA and Implementing Number Matching in MFA Applications. Visit CISA.gov/MFA for more information on MFA, including an infographic of the hierarchy of MFA options.

                              <span>People have suspected this for a while, but Apple has made it official. It only commits to fully patching the latest version of its OS, even though it claims to support older versions.
From ArsTechnica:
In other words, while Apple will provide security-related updates for older versions of its operating systems, only the most recent upgrades will receive updates for every security problem Apple knows about. Apple currently provides security updates to macOS 11 Big Sur and macOS 12 Monterey alongside the newly released macOS Ventura, and in the past, it has released security updates for older iOS versions for devices that can’t install the latest upgrades...</span>

CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) have released Understanding and Responding to Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks to provide organizations proactive steps to reduce the likelihood and impact of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. The guidance is for both network defenders and leaders to help them understand and respond to DDoS attacks, which can cost an organization time, money, and reputational damage.
Concurrently, CISA has released Capacity Enhancement Guide (CEG): Additional DDoS Guidance for Federal Agencies, which provides federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agencies additional DDoS guidance, including recommended FCEB contract vehicles and services that provide DDoS protection and mitigations. 
CISA encourages all network defenders and leaders to review:

CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.      
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA has added six vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.      
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

…the executives had recently discovered that one of their machines had been hacked by a gang of hustlers. The gang used a hidden video camera to record the workings of the card shuffler through a glass window. The images, transmitted to an accomplice outside in the casino parking lot, were played back in slow motion to figure out the sequence of cards in the deck, which was then communicated back to the gamblers inside. The casino lost millions of dollars before the gang were finally caught...</span>

                              <span>Interesting:
A recent study on giant squid that have washed ashore along the Sea of Japan coast has raised the possibility that the animal has a different reproductive method than many other types of squid.
Almost all squid and octopus species are polygamous, with multiple males passing sperm to a single female. Giant squids were thought to have a similar form reproduction.
However, a group led by Professor Noritaka Hirohashi, 57, a professor of reproductive biology in the Faculty of Life and Environmental Sciences at Shimane University suspects differently...</span>

Here’s the latest: a training-time attack that forces the model to exhibit a point of view: Spinning Language Models: Risks of Propaganda-As-A-Service and Countermeasures.”
Abstract: We investigate a new threat to neural sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models: training-time attacks that cause models to “spin” their outputs so as to support an adversary-chosen sentiment or point of view—but only when the input contains adversary-chosen trigger words. For example, a spinned summarization model outputs positive summaries of any text that mentions the name of some individual or organization...</span>

kernel did not properly calculate the header size of a RPC message payload.
A local attacker could use this to expose sensitive information (kernel
memory). (CVE-2022-0812)

Moshe Kol, Amit Klein and Yossi Gilad discovered that the IP implementation
in the Linux kernel did not provide sufficient randomization when
calculating port offsets. An attacker could possibly use this to expose
sensitive information. (CVE-2022-1012, CVE-2022-32296)

Duoming Zhou discovered that race conditions existed in the timer handling
implementation of the Linux kernel&#x27;s Rose X.25 protocol layer, resulting in
use-after-free vulnerabilities. A local attacker could use this to cause a
denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-2318)

Roger Pau Monné discovered that the Xen virtual block driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared
communication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose
sensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-26365)

Roger Pau Monné discovered that the Xen paravirtualization frontend in the
Linux kernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared
communication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose
sensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-33740)

It was discovered that the Xen paravirtualization frontend in the Linux
kernel incorrectly shared unrelated data when communicating with certain
backends. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(guest crash) or expose sensitive information (guest kernel memory).
(CVE-2022-33741, CVE-2022-33742)

Oleksandr Tyshchenko discovered that the Xen paravirtualization platform in
the Linux kernel on ARM platforms contained a race condition in certain
situations. An attacker in a guest VM could use this to cause a denial of
service in the host OS. (CVE-2022-33744)</span>

CISA has added two vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.      
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

That was absolutely a visionary choice that Brian and his team led back in the day ­- and big props to them for doing that. But you can’t just look at that and then stop at message protection. WhatsApp does not protect metadata the way that Signal does. Signal knows nothing about who you are. It doesn’t have your profile information and it has introduced group encryption protections.

Banks don’t take millions of dollars and put them in plastic bags and hang them on the wall so everybody can walk right up to them. But we do basically the same thing in museums and hang the assets right out on the wall. So it’s our job, then, to either use technology or develop technology that protects the art, to hire honest guards that are trainable and able to meet the challenge and alert and so forth. And we have to keep them alert because it’s the world’s most boring job. It might be great for you to go to a museum and see it for a day, but they stand in that same gallery year after year, and so they get mental fatigue. And so we have to rotate them around and give them responsibilities that keep them stimulated and keep them fresh...</span>

calculating port offsets. An attacker could possibly use this to expose
sensitive information. (CVE-2022-1012, CVE-2022-32296)

Duoming Zhou discovered that race conditions existed in the timer handling
implementation of the Linux kernel&#x27;s Rose X.25 protocol layer, resulting in

denial of service (system crash). (CVE-2022-2318)

Roger Pau Monné discovered that the Xen virtual block driver in the Linux
kernel did not properly initialize memory pages to be used for shared
communication with the backend. A local attacker could use this to expose
sensitive information (guest kernel memory). (CVE-2022-26365)

                              <span>USN-5570-1 fixed a vulnerability in zlib. This update provides the
corresponding update for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS and Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

Original advisory details:

 Evgeny Legerov discovered that zlib incorrectly handled memory when
 performing certain inflate operations. An attacker could use this issue
 to cause zlib to crash, resulting in a denial of service, or possibly
 execute arbitrary code.</span>
