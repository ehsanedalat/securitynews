CISA warns users to remain on alert for malicious cyber activity targeting potential disaster victims and charitable donors following a hurricane. Fraudulent emails—often containing malicious links or attachments—are common after major natural disasters. Exercise caution in handling emails with hurricane-related subject lines, attachments, or hyperlinks. In addition, be wary of social media pleas, texts, or door-to-door solicitations relating to severe weather events.
To avoid becoming victims of malicious activity, users and administrators should review the following resources and take preventative measures.
Staying Alert to Disaster-related Scams
Before Giving to a Charity
Staying Safe on Social Networking Sites
Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks
Using Caution with Email Attachments
If you believe you have been a victim of cybercrime, file a complaint with Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) at www.ic3.gov.

CISA has added three vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.      
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA has published its Traffic Light Protocol 2.0 User Guide and Traffic Light Protocol: Moving to Version 2.0 fact sheet in preparation for its November 1, 2022 move from Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Version 1.0 to TLP 2.0.
Managed by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), TLP is a system of markings that communicates information sharing permissions. According to FIRST, the purpose of TLP is &quot;to facilitate greater sharing of potentially sensitive information and more effective collaboration.&quot; Note: Unlike formal classification systems, TLP is not legally binding.
TLP Version 2.0 brings the following key updates:
TLP:CLEAR replaces TLP:WHITE for publicly releasable information.
TLP:AMBER+STRICT supplements TLP:AMBER, clarifying when information may be shared with the recipient’s organization only.
Note: CISA’s Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) capability will not update from TLP 1.0 to TLP 2.0 until March 2023. This exception includes AIS’s use of the following open standards: the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX™) for cyber threat indicators and defensive measures information and the Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXII™) for machine-to-machine communications.
As CISA prepares to implement this update, we want to inform partners of the upcoming change and encourage all network defenders to adopt TLP Version 2.0 to facilitate greater information sharing and collaboration.
For more information on TLP, visit FIRST’s TLP webpage at www.first.org/tlp/. On November 1, 2022, CISA will update www.cisa.gov/tlp to reflect the TLP Version 2.0 changes.

                              <span>It was discovered that the framebuffer driver on the Linux kernel did not
verify size limits when changing font or screen size, leading to an out-of-
bounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33655)

Moshe Kol, Amit Klein and Yossi Gilad discovered that the IP implementation
in the Linux kernel did not provide sufficient randomization when
calculating port offsets. An attacker could possibly use this to expose
sensitive information. (CVE-2022-1012, CVE-2022-32296)

Norbert Slusarek discovered that a race condition existed in the perf
subsystem in the Linux kernel, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1729)

It was discovered that the device-mapper verity (dm-verity) driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly verify targets being loaded into the device-
mapper table. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2503)

Domingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera discovered that the netfilter
subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle rules that truncated
packets below the packet header size. When such rules are in place, a
remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2022-36946)</span>

                        <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/855201">

                              <span>Overview
Layer-2 (L2) network security controls provided by various devices, such as switches, routers, and operating systems, can be bypassed by stacking Ethernet protocol headers. An attacker can send crafted packets through vulnerable devices to cause Denial-of-service (DoS) or to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack against a target network.
Description
This vulnerability exists within Ethernet encapsulation protocols that allow for stacking of Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) headers.  Network standards such as  IEEE 802.1Q-1998 and IEEE 802.3 define a system of tagging Ethernet frames that help isolate networks to provide virtual networking capability.  IEEE standard 802.1ad, also known as QinQ, allows for the stacking of these VLAN tags, extending the VLAN capability into multiple network segments. This widely adopted Ethernet feature is also referred to as &quot;provider bridging&quot; and &quot;stacked VLANs&quot;.  In order to properly isolate and protect these virtual networks, many network devices and operating systems provide an L2 network filtering capability.   It is important to note that in modern computing environments , such as Cloud based virtualization and virtual networking, the L2 network capability is extended beyond the local area networks.  This can lead to exposure of this vulnerabilities in unintended ways to the larger Internet.
The identified vulnerabilities allow an attacker to bypass the security controls by stacking encapsulating headers. This is done by stacking a combination of one or more VLAN 0 (priority tag) headers and 802.2 LLC/SNAP headers.  An attacker can send these crafted network packets and exploit vulnerable devices by bypassing their inspection and filtering capabilities.   Some examples of bypassed L2 inspections include, but are not limited to, Dynamic ARP inspection, IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protection, and IPv6 RA Guard. 
CVE-2021-27853
Layer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard or ARP inspection can be bypassed using combinations of VLAN 0 headers and LLC/SNAP headers.
CVE-2021-27854
Layer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using combinations of VLAN 0 headers, LLC/SNAP headers in Ethernet to Wifi frame translation and the reverse Wifi to Ethernet.
CVE-2021-27861
Layer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using LLC/SNAP headers with invalid length (and optionally VLAN0 headers).
CVE-2021-27862
Layer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using LLC/SNAP headers with invalid length and Ethernet to Wifi frame conversion (and optionally VLAN0 headers).
Impact
An attacker can bypass security controls and deceive a locally connected target host to route traffic to arbitrary destinations.  Victim devices experience either a DoS (blackholing traffic) or MitM (observing the unencrypted traffic and maybe breaking encryption). 
Solution
Apply Updates
Install vendor-provided patches and updates to ensure malicious content is blocked or rejected by the security controls (such as RA Guard), thereby blocking router advertisements or other network configuration related advertisements that originate on host ports.
Inspect and Block Router Advertisements
Utilize the interface security controls on your router or managed switch to perform DHCP snooping, IPv6 RA guard, IP source guard, and ARP/ND inspection. It is also recommended to only allow needed protocol on access ports (ARP/ICMP/IPv4/IPv6), some applications may have additional needs so be prepared to modify the allow list as needed.

                              <span>Okay, it’s an obscure threat. But people are researching it:
Our models and experimental results in a controlled lab setting show it is possible to reconstruct and recognize with over 75 percent accuracy on-screen texts that have heights as small as 10 mm with a 720p webcam.” That corresponds to 28 pt, a font size commonly used for headings and small headlines.

Being able to read reflected headline-size text isn’t quite the privacy and security problem of being able to read smaller 9 to 12 pt fonts. But this technique is expected to provide access to smaller font sizes as high-resolution webcams become more common...</span>

                              <span>Original release date: September 23, 2022
CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2503)

Domingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera discovered that the netfilter
subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle rules that truncated
packets below the packet header size. When such rules are in place, a
remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2022-36946)</span>

CISA has added one new vulnerability to it&#x27;s Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.      
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.   
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

Summary
Traditional approaches to securing OT/ICS do not adequately address current threats. 
Operational technology/industrial control system (OT/ICS) assets that operate, control, and monitor day-to-day critical infrastructure and industrial processes continue to be an attractive target for malicious cyber actors. These cyber actors, including advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, target OT/ICS assets to achieve political gains, economic advantages, or destructive effects. Because OT/ICS systems manage physical operational processes, cyber actors’ operations could result in physical consequences, including loss of life, property damage, and disruption of National Critical Functions.
OT/ICS devices and designs are publicly available, often inco…</span>

CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), Iranian State Actors Conduct Cyber Operations Against the Government of Albania, detailing malicious cyber operations that included ransomware and disk wiper, rendering websites and services unavailable. The advisory indicates Iranian state cyber actors acquired initial access to the victim’s network approximately 14 months before launching the destructive cyber attack, periodically accessing and exfiltrating email content.
Joint CSA: Iranian State Actors Conduct Cyber Operations Against the Government of Albania outlines tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) likely used by Iranian state cyber actors as recently as July 2022. CISA and FBI encourage users and administrators to review the advisory and apply the recommended mitigations to limit the risk of compromise. For additional information on Iranian cyber threats, see CISA’s Iran Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage.

Maybe you heard about the truly insane false-start controversy in track and field? Devon Allen—a wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles—was disqualified from the 110-meter hurdles at the World Athletics Championships a few weeks ago for a false start.
Here’s the problem: You can’t see the false start. Nobody can see the false start. By sight, Allen most definitely does not leave before the gun.
But here’s the thing: World Athletics has determined that it is not possible for someone to push off the block within a tenth of a second of the gun without false starting. They have science that shows it is beyond human capabilities to react that fast. Of course there are those (I’m among them) who would tell you that’s nonsense, that’s pseudoscience, there’s no way that they can limit human capabilities like that. There is science that shows it is humanly impossible to hit a fastball. There was once science that showed human beings could not run a four-minute mile...</span>

                              <span>It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing the calculation
of data that would eventually be used as a reference for bound-checking
operations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of

18.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-19131)

It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly terminating a function
execution when processing incorrect data. An attacker could possibly use
this issue to cause a denial of service or to expose sensitive information.
This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-19144)

It was discovered that LibTIFF did not properly manage memory under certain
circumstances. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF
file using tiffinfo tool, an attacker could possibly use this issue to
cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-1354)

It was discovered that LibTIFF did not properly manage memory under certain
circumstances. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF
file using tiffcp tool, an attacker could possibly use this issue to     
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-1355)

It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing checks to avoid
division calculations where the denominator value was zero, which could
lead to an undefined behaviour situation via a specially crafted file. An
attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.

                              <span>The Washington Post is reporting that the US Customs and Border Protection agency is seizing and copying cell phone, tablet, and computer data from “as many as” 10,000 phones per year, including an unspecified number of American citizens. This is done without a warrant, because “…courts have long granted an exception to border authorities, allowing them to search people’s devices without a warrant or suspicion of a crime.”
CBP’s inspection of people’s phones, laptops, tablets and other electronic devices as they enter the country has long been a controversial practice that the agency has defended as a low-impact way to pursue possible security threats and determine an individual’s “intentions upon entry” into the U.S. But the revelation that thousands of agents have access to a searchable database without public oversight is a new development in what privacy advocates and some lawmakers warn could be an infringement of Americans’ Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures...</span>

                              <span>It’s big:
The breach appeared to have compromised many of Uber’s internal systems, and a person claiming responsibility for the hack sent images of email, cloud storage and code repositories to cybersecurity researchers and The New York Times.
“They pretty much have full access to Uber,” said Sam Curry, a security engineer at Yuga Labs who corresponded with the person who claimed to be responsible for the breach. “This is a total compromise, from what it looks like.”

It looks like a pretty basic phishing attack; someone gave the hacker their login credentials. And because Uber has lousy internal security, lots of people have access to everything. So once a hacker gains a foothold, they have access to everything...</span>

Ethernet driver for the Linux kernel performed insufficient control flow
management. A local attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of
service. (CVE-2021-33061)

Moshe Kol, Amit Klein and Yossi Gilad discovered that the IP implementation
in the Linux kernel did notprovide sufficient randomization when
calculating port offsets. An attacker could possibly use this to expose
sensitive information. (CVE-2022-1012, CVE-2022-32296)

Norbert Slusarek discovered that a race condition existed in the perf
subsystem in the Linux kernel, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1729)

CISA has added six new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates. 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.  
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA and the National Security Agency (NSA) have published Open Radio Access Network Security Considerations. This product—generated by the Enduring Security Framework (ESF) Open Radio Access Network (RAN) Working Panel, a subgroup within the cross-sector working group—assessed the benefits and security considerations associated with implementing an Open RAN architecture. Focusing on current designs and specification standards, the ESF Open RAN Working Panel examined how security compares with, and is distinct from, traditional, proprietary RANs.
CISA encourages users, network operators, vendors, and stakeholders to review the considerations. For more information, see the ESF’s Open Radio Access Network Security Considerations, peruse CISA’s 5G Library, and visit Securing 5G Open RAN Architecture from Cybersecurity Risks.

Radio relay attacks are technically complicated to execute, but conceptually easy to understand: attackers simply extend the range of your existing key using what is essentially a high-tech walkie-talkie. One thief stands near you while you’re in the grocery store, intercepting your key’s transmitted signal with a radio transceiver.

                              <span>USN-5583-1 fixed vulnerabilities in systemd. Unfortunately this caused a 
regression by introducing networking problems for some users. This update fixes
the problem.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

Original advisory details:

 It was discovered that systemd incorrectly handled certain DNS requests, 
 which leads to user-after-free vulnerability. An attacker could possibly use 
 this issue to cause a crash or execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2526)</span>

CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the “Date Added to Catalog” column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), U.S. Cyber Command (USCC) - Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF), Department of the Treasury, Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), and United Kingdom’s National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Affiliated Cyber Actors Exploiting Vulnerabilities for Data Extortion and Disk Encryption for Ransom Operations. This advisory updates previous joint reporting from November 2021, to highlight continued malicious cyber activity by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors that the authoring agencies now assess are associated with the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
The authoring agencies urge network defenders to examine their current cybersecurity posture and apply the recommended mitigations in this joint CSA, which include:
Patch all systems and prioritize remediating known exploited vulnerabilities.
Enforce multifactor authentication (MFA).
Secure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and other risky services.
Make offline backups of your data.
See Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Affiliated Cyber Actors Exploiting Vulnerabilities for Data Extortion and Disk Encryption for Ransom Operations and joint CSA Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities for information on these Iranian government-sponsored APT actors’ tactics and techniques, indicators of compromise, and recommended mitigations. Additionally, review StopRansomware.gov for more guidance on ransomware protection, detection, and response.

Shikitega also downloads Mettle, a Metasploit interpreter that gives the attacker the ability to control attached webcams and includes a sniffer, multiple reverse shells, process control, shell command execution and additional abilities to control the affected system...</span>

CISA has added twelve new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-ISAC) have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), #StopRansomware: Vice Society, to disseminate tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) associated with Vice Society actors identified through FBI investigations as recently as September 2022. Vice Society uses ransomware attacks against the education sector to gain access to, and threaten exposure of, sensitive personal information regarding students and staff for financial gain. 
CISA encourages organizations to review #StopRansomware: Vice Society for more information. Additionally, see StopRansomware.gov for guidance on ransomware protection, detection, and response.
