			CVE Title
			Remediation Due Date
		
 CVE-2022-22620
Apple Webkit Remote Code Execution Vulnerability
2/25/2022
 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

                    <span class="media-object__text">A detailed report of the 2021 ransomware attack against Ireland’s Health Services Executive lists some really bad security practices:
The report notes that:
The HSE did not have a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or a “single responsible owner for cybersecurity at either senior executive or management level to provide leadership and direction.
It had no documented cyber incident response runbooks or IT recovery plans (apart from documented AD recovery plans) for recovering from a wide-scale ransomware event.
Under-resourced Information Security Managers were not performing their business as usual role (including a NIST-based cybersecurity review of systems) but were working on evaluating security controls for the COVID-19 vaccination system. Antivirus software triggered numerous alerts after detecting Cobalt Strike activity but these were not escalated. (The antivirus server was later encrypted in the attack).

Most security schemes facilitate the coercive processes of an attacker because they disclose metadata about the secret data, such as the name and size of encrypted files. This allows specific and enforceable demands to be made: “Give us the passwords for these three encrypted files with names A, B and C, or else…”. In other words, security often focuses on protecting the confidentiality of data, but lacks deniability.
A scheme with deniability would make even the existence of secret files difficult to prove. This makes it difficult for an attacker to formulate a coherent demand: “There’s no evidence of undisclosed data. Should we even bother to make threats?” A lack of evidence makes it more difficult to make specific and enforceable demands...</span>

Finally, we calculate the number of physical qubits required to break the 256-bit elliptic curve encryption of keys in the Bitcoin network within the small available time frame in which it would actually pose a threat to do so. It would require 317 × 106 physical qubits to break the encryption within one hour using the surface code, a code cycle time of 1 μs, a reaction time of 10 μs, and a physical gate error of 10-3. To instead break the encryption within one day, it would require 13 × 10...</span>

On February 8, 2022, SAP released security updates to address vulnerabilities affecting multiple products, including critical vulnerabilities affecting SAP applications using SAP Internet Communication Manager (ICM). SAP applications help organizations manage critical business processes—such as enterprise resource planning, product lifecycle management, customer relationship management, and supply chain management. Impacted organizations could experience:
theft of sensitive data,
financial fraud,
disruption of mission-critical business processes,
ransomware, and
halt of all operations.
Additionally, security researchers from Onapsis, in coordination with SAP, released a Threat Report describing SAP ICM critical vulnerabilities, CVE-2022-22536, CVE-2022-22532 and CVE-2022-22533. Onapsis also provides an open source tool to identify if a system is vulnerable and needs to be patched.
CISA recommends operators of SAP systems review SAP’s February 2022 Security Updates page, the Onapsis Research Labs Threat Report: SAP ICMAD Vulnerabilities, and the Onapsis GitHub page for more information and apply necessary updates and mitigations.

CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence that threat actors are actively exploiting the vulnerabilities listed in the table below. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors of all types and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise.
CVE Number
			CVE Title
			Required Action Due Date
		
CVE-2022-21882  
			Microsoft Win32k Privilege Escalation Vulnerability  
			02/18/2022
		
 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

A group of lawmakers led by Sen. Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) have re-introduced the EARN IT Act, an incredibly unpopular bill from 2020 that was dropped in the face of overwhelming opposition. Let’s be clear: the new EARN IT Act would pave the way for a massive new surveillance system, run by private companies, that would roll back some of the most important privacy and security features in technology used by people around the globe. It’s a framework for private actors to scan every message sent online and report violations to law enforcement. And it might not stop there.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has released a Private Industry Notification (PIN) to warn entities associated with the February 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and March 2022 Paralympics that malicious cyber actors could use a broad range of cyber activities to disrupt these events. These activities include distributed denial-of-service attacks, ransomware, malware, social engineering, data theft or leaks, phishing campaigns, disinformation campaigns, and insider threats. Additionally, the FBI PIN warns Olympic participants and travelers of potential threats associated with mobile applications developed by untrusted vendors. The FBI urges all athletes to keep their personal cell phone at home and use a temporary phone while attending the events.
CISA encourages all travelers to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics to review FBI PIN: Potential for Malicious Cyber Activities to Disrupt the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Paralympics and apply the recommendations.

                    <span>VU#796611: InsydeH2O UEFI software impacted by multiple vulnerabilities in SMM</span>
                    <span class="article-reading-time">13 min</span>
                </summary>
                <a class="article-summary-link article-summary-box-outer" href="https://kb.cert.org/vuls/id/796611">
                  <div class="article-summary-box-inner media-object">
                    <span class="media-object__text">Overview
The InsydeH2O Hardware-2-Operating System (H2O) UEFI firmware contains multiple vulnerabilities related to memory management in System Management Mode (SMM). 
Description
UEFI software provides an extensible interface between an operating system and platform firmware.  UEFI software uses a highly privileged processor execution mode called System Management Mode (SMM) for handling system-wide functions like power management, system hardware control, or proprietary OEM-designed code.  SMM&#x27;s privileges, also referred to as &quot;Ring -2,&quot; exceed the privileges of the operating system&#x27;s kernel (&quot;Ring-0&quot;).  For this reason, SMM is executed in a protected area of memory called the SMRAM.  It is typically accessed via System Management Interrupt (SMI) Handlers using communication buffers, which are also known as &quot;SMM Comm Buffers.&quot;  The SMM also provides protection against SPI flash modifications and performs boot time verifications similar to those performed by SecureBoot.
UEFI software requires both openness (for hardware drivers, pluggable devices and Driver eXecution Environment (DXE) updates) as well as very tight security controls (for e.g., SMM Comm Buffer Security), making it a complex software that needs a thorough set of security controls that need validation throughout the software&#x27;s lifecycle.  UEFI also supports recent capabilities like Virtual Machine Manager (VMM) for virtualization and the increasing demand of virtual computing resources. 
Insyde&#x27;s H2O UEFI firmware contains several (23) memory management vulnerabilities that were disclosed by Binarly.  While these vulnerabilities were discovered in  Fujitsu and Bull Atos implementations of Insyde H2O software, the same software is also present in many other vendor implementations due to the complex UEFI supply chain.  The vulnerabilities can be classified by the following UEFI vulnerability categories.

Vulnerability Category Count 
    

        
            
SMM Privilege Escalation 10 
            
 SMM Memory Corruption  12 
            
 DXE Memory Corruption 1
                
Impact
The impacts of these vulnerabilities vary widely due to the nature of SMM capabilities. As an example, a local attacker with administrative privileges (or a remote attacker with administrative privileges)  can exploit these vulnerabilities to elevate privileges above the operating system to execute arbitrary code in SMM mode.    These attacks can be invoked  from the operating system using the unverified or unsafe SMI Handlers, and in some cases these bugs can also be triggered in the UEFI early boot phases ( as well as sleep and recovery like ACPI) before the operating system is initialized. 
In summary, a local attacker with administrative privileges (in some cases a remote attacker with administrative privileges)  can use malicious software to perform any of the following:
Invalidate many hardware security features (SecureBoot, Intel BootGuard)
Install persistent software that cannot be easily erased
Create backdoors and back communications channels to exfiltrate sensitive data
Solution
Install the latest stable version of firmware provided by your PC vendor or your nearest reseller of your computing environments.  See the links below to resources and updates provided by specific vendors.  
If your operating system supports automatic or managed updates for firmware, such as Linux Vendor Firmware Service (LVFS), apply the related software security updates.  Binarly has also provided a set of UEFI software detection rules called FwHunt rules to assist with identifying vulnerable software.  LVFS applies these FwHunt rules to detect and support the fix of firmware updates that are impacted by this advisory.
Acknowledgements
The efiXplorer team of Binarly researched and reported these vulnerabilities to Insyde Software.  Insyde Software worked closely with CERT/CC during the coordinated disclosure process for these vulnerabilities.

                    <span class="media-object__text">There are two bills working their way through Congress that would force companies like Apple to allow competitive app stores. Apple hates this, since it would break its monopoly, and it’s making a variety of security arguments to bolster its argument. I have written a rebuttal:
I would like to address some of the unfounded security concerns raised about these bills. It’s simply not true that this legislation puts user privacy and security at risk. In fact, it’s fairer to say that this legislation puts those companies’ extractive business-models at risk. Their claims about risks to privacy and security are both false and disingenuous, and motivated by their own self-interest and not the public interest. App store monopolies cannot protect users from every risk, and they frequently prevent the distribution of important tools that actually enhance security. Furthermore, the alleged risks of third-party app stores and “side-loading” apps pale in comparison to their benefits. These bills will encourage competition, prevent monopolist extortion, and guarantee users a new right to digital self-determination...</span>

                    <span class="media-object__text">Overview
The Samba vfs_fruit module allows out-of-bounds heap read and write via extended file attributes (CVE-2021-44142). This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
Description
The Samba vfs_fruit module uses extended file attributes (EA, xattr) to provide &quot;...enhanced compatibility with Apple SMB clients and interoperability with a Netatalk 3 AFP fileserver.&quot; Samba with vfs_fruit configured allows out-of-bounds heap read and write via specially crafted extended file attributes.
For more information, see the Samba announcement for CVE-2021-44142 and bug 14914.
Impact
A remote attacker with write access to extended file attributes can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of smbd, typically root.
From the Samba annoucement for CVE-2021-44142:
Access as a user that has write access to a file&#x27;s extended attributes is required to exploit this vulnerability. Note that this could be a guest or unauthenticated user if such users are allowed write access to file extended attributes.
Solution
Apply an update
Samba has released versions 4.13.17, 4.14.12, and 4.15.5.
Disable vfs_fruit
As a workaround, remove &#x27;fruit&#x27; from &#x27;vfs objects&#x27; lines in Samba configuration files (e.g., smb.conf).

CISA has published an infographic to emphasize the importance of implementing network segmentation—a physical or virtual architectural approach that divides a network into multiple segments, each acting as its own subnetwork, to provide additional security and control that can help prevent or minimize the impact of a cyberattack.
CISA encourages network architects, defenders, and administrators to review the infographic, Layering Network Security Through Segmentation, and implement its recommendations where possible.

			CVE Title
			Required Action Due Date
		
CVE-2006-1547
			Apache Struts 1 ActionForm Denial of Service Vulnerability
			07/21/2022
		
CVE-2012-0391

Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilities established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See the BOD 22-01 Fact Sheet for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilities as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the meet the specified criteria.

This surveillance invaded the privacy of protesters, targeted people of color, and chills and deters participation and organizing for future protests. The SFPD also violated San Francisco’s new Surveillance Technology Ordinance. It prohibits city agencies like the SFPD from acquiring, borrowing, or using surveillance technology, without prior approval from the city’s Board of Supervisors, following an open process that includes public participation.
