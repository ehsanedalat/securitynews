                              <span>Researchers have used thermal cameras and ML guessing techniques to recover passwords from measuring the residual heat left by fingers on keyboards. From the abstract:
We detail the implementation of ThermoSecure and make a dataset of 1,500 thermal images of keyboards with heat traces resulting from input publicly available. Our first study shows that ThermoSecure successfully attacks 6-symbol, 8-symbol, 12-symbol, and 16-symbol passwords with an average accuracy of 92%, 80%, 71%, and 55% respectively, and even higher accuracy when thermal images are taken within 30 seconds. We found that typing behavior significantly impacts vulnerability to thermal attacks, where hunt-and-peck typists are more vulnerable than fast typists (92% vs 83% thermal attack success if performed within 30 seconds). The second study showed that the keycaps material has a statistically significant effect on the effectiveness of thermal attacks: ABS keycaps retain the thermal trace of users presses for a longer period of time, making them more vulnerable to thermal attacks, with a 52% average attack accuracy compared to 14% for keyboards with PBT keycaps...</span>

CISA has added one new vulnerability to itsâ¯Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. This type of vulnerability is a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.â¯â¯â¯Â  Â 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilitiesâ¯established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See theâ¯BOD 22-01 Fact Sheetâ¯for more information.â¯â¯â¯
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce theirâ¯exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation ofâ¯Catalog vulnerabilitiesâ¯as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.â¯

Abstract: Early backdoor attacks against machine learning set off an arms race in attack and defence development. Defences have since appeared demonstrating some ability to detect backdoors in models or even remove them. These defences work by inspecting the training data, the model, or the integrity of the training procedure. In this work, we show that backdoors can be added during compilation, circumventing any safeguards in the data preparation and model training stages. As an illustration, the attacker can insert weight-based backdoors during the hardware compilation step that will not be detected by any training or data-preparation process. Next, we demonstrate that some backdoors, such as ImpNet, can only be reliably detected at the stage where they are inserted and removing them anywhere else presents a significant challenge. We conclude that machine-learning model security requires assurance of provenance along the entire technical pipeline, including the data, model architecture, compiler, and hardware specification...</span>

Koukakis is suing Intellexa.
The lawsuit filed by Koukakis takes aim at Intellexa and its executive, alleging a criminal breach of privacy and communication laws, reports Haaretz. The founder of Intellexa, a former Israeli intelligence commander named Taj Dilian, is listed as one of the defendants in the suit, as is another shareholder, Sara Hemo, and the firm itself.

                              <span>Overview
The Heimdal Software Kerberos 5 implementation is vulnerable to a null pointer dereferance. An attacker with network access to an application that depends on the vulnerable code path can cause the application to crash.
Description
A flawed logical condition allows a malicious actor to remotely trigger a NULL pointer dereference using a crafted negTokenInit token.
Impact
An attacker can use a specially crafted network packet to cause a vulnerable application to crash.
Solution
The latest version of code in the Heimdal master branch fixes the issue. However, the current stable release 7.7.0 does not include the fix.

CISA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the National Security Agency (NSA) have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA) providing the top Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) used since 2020 by Peopleâs Republic of China (PRC) state-sponsored cyber actors. PRC state-sponsored cyber actors continue to exploit known vulnerabilities to actively target U.S. and allied networks, including software and hardware companies to illegally obtain intellectual property and develop access into sensitive networks.
CISA, the FBI, and the NSA urge U.S. and allied governments, critical infrastructure, and private sector organizations to apply the recommendations listed in the Top CVEs Actively Exploited by Peopleâs Republic of China State-Sponsored Cyber Actors to increase their defensive posture and reduce the threat of compromise from PRC state-sponsored malicious cyber actors.
For more information on PRC state-sponsored malicious cyber activity, see CISAâs China Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage, the FBIâs Industry Alerts, and the NSAâs Cybersecurity Advisories &amp; Guidance.

Summary
Actions to Help Protect Against Russian State-Sponsored Malicious Cyber Activity:
From November 2021 through January 2022, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) responded to advanced persistent threat (APT) activity on a Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector organizationâs enterprise network. During incident response activities, CISA uncovered that likely multiple APT groups compromised the organizationâs network, and some APT actors had long-term access to the environment. APT actors used an open-source toolkit called Impacket to gain their foothold within the environment and further compromise the network, and also used a custom data exfiltration tool, CovalentStealer, to steal the victimâs sensitive data.

CISA, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and the National Security Agency (NSA) have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), Impacket and Exfiltration Tool Used to Steal Sensitive Information from Defense Industrial Base Organization, highlighting advanced persistent threat (APT) activity observed on a Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Sector organizationâs enterprise network. ATP actors used the open-source toolkit, Impacket, to gain a foothold within the environment and data exfiltration tool, CovalentStealer, to steal the victimâs sensitive data.
Joint Cybersecurity Advisory AA22-277A provides the APT actors tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs). CISA, FBI, and NSA recommend DIB sector and other critical infrastructure organizations implement the mitigations in this CSA to ensure they are managing and reducing the impact of APT cyber threats to their networks.

Itâs a weird story, and the FBI affidavit raises more questions than it answers. The employee only worked for the NSA for three weeksâwhich is weird in itself. I canât figure out how he linked up with the undercover FBI agent. Itâs not clear how much of this was the employeeâs idea, and whether he was goaded by the FBI agent. Still, hooray for not leaking NSA secrets to the Russians. (And, almost ten years after Snowden, do we still have this much trouble vetting people before giving them security clearances?)...</span>

                              <span>Overview
Microsoft Exchange 2019 Cumulative Update 23 and earlier versions are vulnerable to a server-side request forgery (SSRF) attack and remote code execution.  An authenticated attacker can use the combination of these two vulnerabilities to elevate privileges and execute arbitrary code on the target Exchange server. 
Description
Microsoft Exchange Server&#x27;s  Autodiscover service is a web service widely available to any Microsoft Exchange Web Services (EWS) client.  Since Microsoft Exchange version 2016, the Autodiscover service has become an integral part of the Microsoft Exchange system, and it is no longer independently provided by a Client Access server.  The Autodiscover service and a number of other privileged mailbox services are hosted on the default Internet Information Services server running on the Mailbox server.  
Cybersecurity company GTSC observed an abuse of the Autodiscover service in August of 2022 using a crafted URL SSRF attack, similar to the earlier ProxyShell vulnerability reported in August 2021.  The observed attack appears to have implemented CVE-2022-41040 to gain privileged access and CVE-2022-41082 to perform remote code execution via PowerShell.  Microsoft Security Research Center has acknowledged the vulnerability and provided guidance for mitigation.  The guidance highlights that Microsoft Exchange Online customers will be provided with detection and mitigation defenses automatically from Microsoft&#x27;s managed Infrastructure, informing them of any attempts to exploit these vulnerabilities. 
Impact
An authenticated remote attacker can perform SSRF attacks to escalate privileges and execute arbtirary PowerShell code on vulnerable Microsoft Exchange servers.  As the attack is targeted against Microsoft Exchange Mailbox server, the attacker can potentially gain access to other resources via lateral movement into Exchange and Active Directory environments.
Solution
Workaround guidance
Microsoft has provided guidance in their recent blog post to address the issue.  Jang notes that the guidance can be bypassed due to a small error in the URL filter .*autodiscover\.json.*\@.*Powershell.* which is detailed in step 6 under Option 3.  The recommended block pattern is  .*autodiscover\.json.*Powershell.* (excluding the @ symbol) as a regular expression to prevent known variants of the #ProxyNotShell attacks.
Apply update when available
As of October 3, 2022, there is no patch available to mitigate this issue. It is recommended that Microsoft Exchange administrators stay on alert for any advisory or patch released by Microsoft.  
Third-party web application protection
Exchange Administrators who use third-party Web Application Firewall (WAF) products can implement the recommended URL filters and blocks as part of their WAF policy.
Other mitigations
Exchange Administrators can limit the outgoing connection from the Exchange Mailbox server using specific whitelisting on an outgoing proxy to limit suspicious web requests.

                              <span>USN-5651-1 fixed a vulnerability in strongSwan. This update provides
the corresponding update for Ubuntu 14.04 ESM and Ubuntu 16.04 ESM.

Original advisory details:

 Lahav Schlesinger discovered that strongSwan incorrectly handled certain OCSP URIs and
 and CRL distribution points (CDP) in certificates. A remote attacker could
 possibly use this issue to initiate IKE_SAs and send crafted certificates
 that contain URIs pointing to servers under their control, which can lead
 to a denial-of-service attack.</span>

Although BOD 23-01 is only applicable to federal civilian executive branch (FCEB) agencies, CISA recommends all stakeholders review and incorporate the standards it sets forth. Doing so will ensure asset management and vulnerability detection practices that will strengthen their organizationâs cyber resilience.

                              <span>This is interesting research:
In this paper, we develop a new mechanism for detecting audio deepfakes using techniques from the field of articulatory phonetics. Specifically, we apply fluid dynamics to estimate the arrangement of the human vocal tract during speech generation and show that deepfakes often model impossible or highly-unlikely anatomical arrangements. When parameterized to achieve 99.9% precision, our detection mechanism achieves a recall of 99.5%, correctly identifying all but one deepfake sample in our dataset.

CISA warns users to remain on alert for malicious cyber activity targeting potential disaster victims and charitable donors following a hurricane. Fraudulent emailsâoften containing malicious links or attachmentsâare common after major natural disasters. Exercise caution in handling emails with hurricane-related subject lines, attachments, or hyperlinks. In addition, be wary of social media pleas, texts, or door-to-door solicitations relating to severe weather events.
To avoid becoming victims of malicious activity, users and administrators should review the following resources and take preventative measures.
Staying Alert to Disaster-related Scams
Before Giving to a Charity
Staying Safe on Social Networking Sites
Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks
Using Caution with Email Attachments
If you believe you have been a victim of cybercrime, file a complaint with Federal Bureau of Investigationâs Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) atâ¯www.ic3.gov.Â

CISA has added three vulnerabilities to itsâ¯Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.â¯â¯â¯Â  Â 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilitiesâ¯established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See theâ¯BOD 22-01Â Fact Sheetâ¯for more information.â¯â¯â¯
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce theirâ¯exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilitiesâ¯as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.â¯â¯

CISA has published its Traffic Light Protocol 2.0 User Guide and Traffic Light Protocol: Moving to Version 2.0 fact sheet in preparation for itsÂ November 1, 2022 move from Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) Version 1.0 to TLP 2.0.
Managed by the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), TLP is a system of markings that communicates information sharing permissions. According to FIRST, the purpose of TLP is &quot;to facilitate greater sharing of potentially sensitive information and more effective collaboration.&quot; Note: Unlike formal classification systems, TLP is not legally binding.
TLP Version 2.0 brings the following key updates:
TLP:CLEAR replaces TLP:WHITE for publicly releasable information.
TLP:AMBER+STRICT supplements TLP:AMBER, clarifying when information may be shared with the recipientâs organization only.
Note: CISAâs Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) capability will not update from TLP 1.0 to TLP 2.0 until March 2023. This exception includes AISâs use of the following open standards: the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIXâ¢) for cyber threat indicators and defensive measures information and the Trusted Automated Exchange of Intelligence Information (TAXIIâ¢) for machine-to-machine communications.
As CISA prepares to implement this update, we want to inform partners of the upcoming change and encourage all network defenders to adopt TLP Version 2.0 to facilitate greater information sharing and collaboration.
For more information on TLP, visit FIRSTâs TLP webpage at www.first.org/tlp/. On November 1, 2022, CISA will update www.cisa.gov/tlp to reflect the TLP Version 2.0 changes.

                              <span>It was discovered that the framebuffer driver on the Linux kernel did not
verify size limits when changing font or screen size, leading to an out-of-
bounds write. A local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2021-33655)

Moshe Kol, Amit Klein and Yossi Gilad discovered that the IP implementation
in the Linux kernel did not provide sufficient randomization when
calculating port offsets. An attacker could possibly use this to expose
sensitive information. (CVE-2022-1012, CVE-2022-32296)

Norbert Slusarek discovered that a race condition existed in the perf
subsystem in the Linux kernel, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-1729)

It was discovered that the device-mapper verity (dm-verity) driver in the
Linux kernel did not properly verify targets being loaded into the device-
mapper table. A privileged attacker could use this to cause a denial of
service (system crash) or possibly execute arbitrary code. (CVE-2022-2503)

Domingo Dirutigliano and Nicola Guerrera discovered that the netfilter
subsystem in the Linux kernel did not properly handle rules that truncated
packets below the packet header size. When such rules are in place, a
remote attacker could possibly use this to cause a denial of service
(system crash). (CVE-2022-36946)</span>

                              <span>Overview
Layer-2 (L2) network security controls provided by various devices, such as switches, routers, and operating systems, can be bypassed by stacking Ethernet protocol headers. An attacker can send crafted packets through vulnerable devices to cause Denial-of-service (DoS) or to perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack against a target network.
Description
This vulnerability exists within Ethernet encapsulation protocols that allow for stacking of Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) headers.  Network standards such as  IEEE 802.1Q-1998 and IEEE 802.3 define a system of tagging Ethernet frames that help isolate networks to provide virtual networking capability.  IEEE standard 802.1ad, also known as QinQ, allows for the stacking of these VLAN tags, extending the VLAN capability into multiple network segments. This widely adopted Ethernet feature is also referred to as &quot;provider bridging&quot; and &quot;stacked VLANs&quot;.  In order to properly isolate and protect these virtual networks, many network devices and operating systems provide an L2 network filtering capability.   It is important to note that in modern computing environments , such as Cloud based virtualization and virtual networking, the L2 network capability is extended beyond the local area networks.  This can lead to exposure of this vulnerabilities in unintended ways to the larger Internet.
The identified vulnerabilities allow an attacker to bypass the security controls by stacking encapsulating headers. This is done by stacking a combination of one or more VLAN 0 (priority tag) headers and 802.2 LLC/SNAP headers.  An attacker can send these crafted network packets and exploit vulnerable devices by bypassing their inspection and filtering capabilities.   Some examples of bypassed L2 inspections include, but are not limited to, Dynamic ARP inspection, IPv6 Neighbor Discovery (ND) protection, and IPv6 RA Guard. 
CVE-2021-27853
Layer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard or ARP inspection can be bypassed using combinations of VLAN 0 headers and LLC/SNAP headers.
CVE-2021-27854
Layer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using combinations of VLAN 0 headers, LLC/SNAP headers in Ethernet to Wifi frame translation and the reverse Wifi to Ethernet.
CVE-2021-27861
Layer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using LLC/SNAP headers with invalid length (and optionally VLAN0 headers).
CVE-2021-27862
Layer 2 network filtering capabilities such as IPv6 RA guard can be bypassed using LLC/SNAP headers with invalid length and Ethernet to Wifi frame conversion (and optionally VLAN0 headers).
Impact
An attacker can bypass security controls and deceive a locally connected target host to route traffic to arbitrary destinations.  Victim devices experience either a DoS (blackholing traffic) or MitM (observing the unencrypted traffic and maybe breaking encryption). 
Solution
Apply Updates
Install vendor-provided patches and updates to ensure malicious content is blocked or rejected by the security controls (such as RA Guard), thereby blocking router advertisements or other network configuration related advertisements that originate on host ports.
Inspect and Block Router Advertisements
Utilize the interface security controls on your router or managed switch to perform DHCP snooping, IPv6 RA guard, IP source guard, and ARP/ND inspection. It is also recommended to only allow needed protocol on access ports (ARP/ICMP/IPv4/IPv6), some applications may have additional needs so be prepared to modify the allow list as needed.

Our models and experimental results in a controlled lab setting show it is possible to reconstruct and recognize with over 75 percent accuracy on-screen texts that have heights as small as 10 mm with a 720p webcam.â That corresponds to 28 pt, a font size commonly used for headings and small headlines.

Being able to read reflected headline-size text isnât quite the privacy and security problem of being able to read smaller 9 to 12 pt fonts. But this technique is expected to provide access to smaller font sizes as high-resolution webcams become more common...</span>

CISA has added one new vulnerability to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilitiesâ¯established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See theâ¯BOD 22-01 Fact Sheetâ¯for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce theirâ¯exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation ofâ¯Catalog vulnerabilitiesâ¯as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA has added one new vulnerability to it&#x27;sâ¯Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: To view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.â¯â¯â¯Â  Â 
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilitiesâ¯established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See theâ¯BOD 22-01 Fact Sheetâ¯for more information.â¯â¯â¯
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce theirâ¯exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation ofâ¯Catalog vulnerabilitiesâ¯as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.â¯â¯â¯Â  Â

CISA and the National Security Agency (NSA) have published a joint cybersecurity advisory about control system defense for operational technology (OT) and industrial control systems (ICSs). Control System Defense: Know the Opponent is intended to provide critical infrastructure owners and operators with an understanding of the tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by malicious cyber actors. This advisory builds on NSA and CISA 2021 guidance provided to stop malicious ICS activity against connect OT, and 2020 guidance to reduce OT exposure.
CISA and NSA encourage critical infrastructure owners and operations to review the advisory, Control System Defense: Know the Opponent, and apply the recommended mitigations and actions. For more information on CISAâs resources and efforts to improve ICS cybersecurity, visit CISAâs role in industrial control systems webpage.

Summary
Traditional approaches to securing OT/ICS do not adequately address current threats. 
Operational technology/industrial control system (OT/ICS) assets that operate, control, and monitor day-to-day critical infrastructure and industrial processes continue to be an attractive target for malicious cyber actors. These cyber actors, including advanced persistent threat (APT) groups, target OT/ICS assets to achieve political gains, economic advantages, or destructive effects. Because OT/ICS systems manage physical operational processes, cyber actorsâ operations could result in physical consequences, including loss of life, property damage, and disruption of National Critical Functions.

CISA and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), Iranian State Actors Conduct Cyber Operations Against the Government of Albania, detailing malicious cyber operations that included ransomware and disk wiper, rendering websites and services unavailable. The advisory indicates Iranian state cyber actors acquired initial access to the victimâs network approximately 14 months before launching the destructive cyber attack, periodically accessing and exfiltrating email content.
Joint CSA: Iranian State Actors Conduct Cyber Operations Against the Government of Albania outlines tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and indicators of compromise (IOCs) likely used by Iranian state cyber actors as recently as July 2022. CISA and FBI encourage users and administrators to review the advisory and apply the recommended mitigations to limit the risk of compromise. For additional information on Iranian cyber threats, see CISAâs Iran Cyber Threat Overview and Advisories webpage.

                              <span>Almost every vendor, from email gateway companies to developers of threat intelligence platforms, is positioning themselves as an XDR player. But unfortunately, the noise around XDR makes it harder for buyers to find solutions that might be right for them or, more importantly, avoid ones that don&#x27;t meet their needs.Â

                              <span>This is a fascinating glimpse of the future of automatic cheating detection in sports:
Maybe you heard about the truly insane false-start controversy in track and field? Devon Allenâa wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eaglesâwas disqualified from the 110-meter hurdles at the World Athletics Championships a few weeks ago for a false start.
Hereâs the problem: You canât see the false start. Nobody can see the false start. By sight, Allen most definitely does not leave before the gun.
But hereâs the thing: World Athletics has determined that it is not possible for someone to push off the block within a tenth of a second of the gun without false starting. They have science that shows it is beyond human capabilities to react that fast. Of course there are those (Iâm among them) who would tell you thatâs nonsense, thatâs pseudoscience, thereâs no way that they can limit human capabilities like that. There is science that shows it is humanly impossible to hit a fastball. There was once science that showed human beings could not run a four-minute mile...</span>

                              <span>It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing the calculation
of data that would eventually be used as a reference for bound-checking
operations. An attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of
service or to expose sensitive information. This issue only affected Ubuntu
18.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-19131)

It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly terminating a function
execution when processing incorrect data. An attacker could possibly use
this issue to cause a denial of service or to expose sensitive information.
This issue only affected Ubuntu 18.04 LTS. (CVE-2020-19144)

It was discovered that LibTIFF did not properly manage memory under certain
circumstances. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF
file using tiffinfo tool, an attacker could possibly use this issue to
cause a denial of service. This issue only affected Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and
Ubuntu 22.04 LTS. (CVE-2022-1354)

It was discovered that LibTIFF did not properly manage memory under certain
circumstances. If a user were tricked into opening a specially crafted TIFF
file using tiffcp tool, an attacker could possibly use this issue to     
cause a denial of service. (CVE-2022-1355)

It was discovered that LibTIFF was not properly performing checks to avoid
division calculations where the denominator value was zero, which could
lead to an undefined behaviour situation via a specially crafted file. An
attacker could possibly use this issue to cause a denial of service.

                              <span>USN-5613-1 fixed vulnerabilities in Vim. Unfortunately that update failed
to include binary packages for some architectures. This update fixes that
regression.

We apologize for the inconvenience.

This is done without a warrant, because ââ¦courts have long granted an exception to border authorities, allowing them to search peopleâs devices without a warrant or suspicion of a crime.â
CBPâs inspection of peopleâs phones, laptops, tablets and other electronic devices as they enter the country has long been a controversial practice that the agency has defended as a low-impact way to pursue possible security threats and determine an individualâs âintentions upon entryâ into the U.S. But the revelation that thousands of agents have access to a searchable database without public oversight is a new development in what privacy advocates and some lawmakers warn could be an infringement of Americansâ Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable searches and seizures...</span>

calculating port offsets. An attacker could possibly use this to expose
sensitive information. (CVE-2022-1012, CVE-2022-32296)

Norbert Slusarek discovered that a race condition existed in the perf
subsystem in the Linux kernel, resulting in a use-after-free vulnerability.
A privileged local attacker could use this to cause a denial of service

CISA has added six new vulnerabilities to itsâ¯Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the &quot;Date Added to Catalog&quot; column, which will sort by descending dates.â¯
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilitiesâ¯established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See theâ¯BOD 22-01 Fact Sheetâ¯for more information.â¯â¯
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce theirâ¯exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation ofâ¯Catalog vulnerabilitiesâ¯as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA and the National Security Agency (NSA) have published Open Radio Access Network Security Considerations. This productâgenerated by the Enduring Security Framework (ESF) Open Radio Access Network (RAN) Working Panel, a subgroup within the cross-sector working groupâassessed the benefits and security considerations associated with implementing an Open RAN architecture. Focusing on current designs and specification standards, the ESF Open RAN Working Panel examined how security compares with, and is distinct from, traditional, proprietary RANs.
CISA encourages users, network operators, vendors, and stakeholders to review the considerations. For more information, see the ESFâs Open Radio Access Network Security Considerations, peruse CISAâs 5G Library, and visit Securing 5G Open RAN Architecture from Cybersecurity Risks.

Radio relay attacks are technically complicated to execute, but conceptually easy to understand: attackers simply extend the range of your existing key using what is essentially a high-tech walkie-talkie. One thief stands near you while youâre in the grocery store, intercepting your keyâs transmitted signal with a radio transceiver. Another stands near your car, with another transceiver, taking the signal from their friend and passing it on to the car. Since the car and the key can now talk, through the thievesâ range extenders, the car has no reason to suspect the key isnât insideâand fires right up...</span>

CISA has added two new vulnerabilities to its Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog, based on evidence of active exploitation. These types of vulnerabilities are a frequent attack vector for malicious cyber actors and pose significant risk to the federal enterprise. Note: to view the newly added vulnerabilities in the catalog, click on the arrow in the âDate Added to Catalogâ column, which will sort by descending dates.
Binding Operational Directive (BOD) 22-01: Reducing the Significant Risk of Known Exploited Vulnerabilitiesâ¯established the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities Catalog as a living list of known CVEs that carry significant risk to the federal enterprise. BOD 22-01 requires FCEB agencies to remediate identified vulnerabilities by the due date to protect FCEB networks against active threats. See theâ¯BOD 22-01 Fact Sheetâ¯for more information.
Although BOD 22-01 only applies to FCEB agencies, CISA strongly urges all organizations to reduce their exposure to cyberattacks by prioritizing timely remediation of Catalog vulnerabilitiesÂ as part of their vulnerability management practice. CISA will continue to add vulnerabilities to the Catalog that meet the specified criteria.

CISA, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), National Security Agency (NSA), U.S. Cyber Command (USCC) - Cyber National Mission Force (CNMF), Department of the Treasury, Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC), Canadian Centre for Cyber Security (CCCS), and United Kingdomâs National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) have released a joint Cybersecurity Advisory (CSA), Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Affiliated Cyber Actors Exploiting Vulnerabilities for Data Extortion and Disk Encryption for Ransom Operations. This advisory updates previous joint reportingÂ from November 2021, to highlight continued malicious cyber activity by advanced persistent threat (APT) actors that the authoring agencies now assess are associated with the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).
The authoring agencies urge network defenders to examine their current cybersecurity posture and apply the recommended mitigations in this joint CSA, which include:
Patch all systems and prioritize remediating known exploited vulnerabilities.
Enforce multifactor authentication (MFA).
Secure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and other risky services.
Make offline backups of your data.
See Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps Affiliated Cyber Actors Exploiting Vulnerabilities for Data Extortion and Disk Encryption for Ransom OperationsÂ and joint CSA Iranian Government-Sponsored APT Cyber Actors Exploiting Microsoft Exchange and Fortinet Vulnerabilities in Furtherance of Malicious Activities for information on these Iranian government-sponsored APT actorsâ tactics and techniques, indicators of compromise, and recommended mitigations. Additionally, review StopRansomware.govÂ for more guidance on ransomware protection, detection, and response.
